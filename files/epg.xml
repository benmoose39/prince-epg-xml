    <title>The Krays</title>
    <desc>The disturbing story of the making of the infamous 60s underworld figures Reggie and Ronnie Kray - from their upbringing by a domineering mother in the deprivation of London's East End. The gangland empire they build is characterised by violence and intimidation, and the film is unflinching in its depiction of their rise to power.</desc>
