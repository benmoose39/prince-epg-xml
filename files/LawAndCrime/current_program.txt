Cops Reloaded
"Cops" has been producing new episodes for more than 20 years, and with daily repeats of the iconic series entering their second decade on the air, producers felt it was time for a change to freshen things up, which is how the idea for "Cops Reloaded" was born. This entry in the long-running franchise takes footage from previous episodes and re-edits it to produce new episodes. Some of the program's wildest criminals, most memorable car chases, and craziest moments are featured on "Reloaded.".
