    <title>Bizarre Foods America</title>
    <desc>The continuation of &quot;Bizarre Foods&quot; finds Andrew Zimmern keeping his passport at home, as the chef and writer embarks on a culinary exploration of the great U, S of A. From traditional foods passed down through generations to modern eats whose roots are purely American, the United States is home to a smorgasbord of bizarre foods and equally extraordinary stories associated with them. So who best to taste and tell than Andrew, the man who lives by the motto &quot;If it looks good, eat it&quot;? The cultural cuisine master has done plenty of that throughout the history of &quot;Bizarre Foods,&quot; with the &quot;America&quot; incarnation including a celebration of the series' 100th episode.</desc>
