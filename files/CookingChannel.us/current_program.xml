    <title>Burgers, Brew &amp; 'Que</title>
    <desc>Burgers, beer and barbecue are staples of many adult Americans' diets and the centerpiece of this series hosted by chef and restaurateur Michael Symon; throughout the first season, he heads to three cities across the U.S. - New York, Nashville and his native Cleveland - to discover the best each city has to offer in each of the three delicacies featured in the show - from a Nashville burger joint that creates custom dishes at diners' requests to an over-the-top barbecue joint in the Big Apple; Symon seeks out some hidden - and not-so-hidden - gems in the cities he frequents; some of his fellow Food Network personalities, including Bobby Flay and Alex Guarnaschelli, join Symon during his journeys. After Season 1, Symon broadens his scope, expanding his itinerary to add locations in more cities, including New Orleans, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Austin, Texas.</desc>
