    <title>Man Finds Food</title>
    <desc>Adam Richman's years of experience crisscrossing the U.S. to find delicious food items in off-the-grid establishments comes in handy once again. The longtime host of the iconic Travel Channel series &quot;Man v Food,&quot; Richman has tasted countless culinary gems and introduced viewers to platefuls of cuisine secrets buried in the American food scene. He's at it again in &quot;Man Finds Food,&quot; on the prowl for off-the-menu items - available only to connected connoisseurs - served at out-of-the-way eateries. Whether it's smoked redfish on the half shell in New Orleans; braised short ribs in Honolulu; a Reuben omelet and French toast combo in Las Vegas; or lamb shank pie in Boston, Richman finds tasty treasures and meets, greets and eats with some of the most interesting people in America.</desc>
