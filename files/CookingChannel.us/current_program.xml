    <title>Halloween Baking Championship</title>
    <desc>There are tricks and treats in this sister show to the seasonal &quot;Holiday Baking Championship.&quot; Bakers are tasked with creating spooky treats in Halloween-themed challenges. As the competition heats up, judges - who have included Lorraine Pascale, Stephanie Boswell, Carla Hall and Zac Young - eliminate contestants. The best keep moving through rounds as the tasks and challenges become more complicated. The champion of the &quot;Main Heat&quot; gets a $25,000 prize and the prestige of being declared winner of the season's creepiest cooking contest.</desc>
