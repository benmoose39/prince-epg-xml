    <title>Holiday Wars</title>
    <desc>Teams of cake masters and sugar artists face off in wintry challenges to see who can make the most mind-blowing displays. Each stage in the tournament is then judged by professionals. While the holidays may be stressful, viewers can take solace in knowing that their holidays probably won't involve creating the holiday-themed masterpieces on &quot;Holiday Wars,&quot; and that their only judges will be family members. As the teams close in on the finale, they have the chance of winning a cash prize and the prestige that comes with winning the competition.</desc>
