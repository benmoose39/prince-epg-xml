    <title>Halloween Wars</title>
    <desc>Teams of cake decorators, candy-makers and pumpkin carvers compete to see who can make the biggest, wildest and spookiest edible Halloween creations. They may end up walking home with a big cash prize and scare viewers' pants off with some of the most amazing horror tales, all made from cake, candy and pumpkins. A sister show to &quot;Holiday Wars&quot; and an annual favorite, &quot;Halloween Wars&quot; has had new seasons every year since 2011. While the judges and hosts may change each year, the creativity never does.</desc>
