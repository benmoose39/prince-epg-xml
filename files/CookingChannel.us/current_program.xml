    <desc>There is, of course, much more to a vacation experience than hotels, sightseeing and souvenirs. For a look at what is literally on the menu, Travel Channel takes a tour of the must-see eateries across the country where a one-of-a-kind dining experience can be had. There are places that serve lip-smacking pizza, tasty deli entrees, boatloads of bacon, fresh seafood, finger-licking deep-fried dishes, juicy steaks, hot-and-spicy favorites - the list that can whet anyone's appetite goes on and on. Each episode focuses on a specific type of food, and there's even episodic room reserved for desserts, such as ice cream and pie.</desc>
