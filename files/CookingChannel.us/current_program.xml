    <desc>No eatery is too far for Roger Mooking, as he sets out on a culinary pilgrimage to find the greatest foods. He works to visit the 15 best spots for America's most beloved and succulent foods, including mouth-watering steaks and smoky barbecue, seafood from the Pacific to the Atlantic and down to the bayou, sandwiches, pork, large pizzas, and a favorite of American households, juicy hamburgers. Mooking visits locations such as Louisiana and Florida and travels from Miami to New Orleans.</desc>
