    <title>Carnival Eats</title>
    <desc>There's lots to do at a carnival: playing the games, riding the rides, delighting in the noise and the neon. But for some, the best part of a carnival is the food, some of it unique to that milieu. Carnival Eats targets the culinary creations linked to American fairgrounds. Calorie-loaded offerings include rattlesnake, frog legs, or okra - all deep-fried - and a decadent sundae of eight doughnuts topped with whipped cream, chocolate or caramel, and don't forget the cherry! Host Noah Cappe, a novice cook, tries his hand at making some of the items.</desc>

    <title>Man Fire Food</title>
    <desc>Roger Mooking has a fascination with fire. The chef enjoys finding inventive ways to cook with fire, which is exactly what he does in this series that takes him on a journey across the U.S. He visits pit-masters, chefs and home cooks who use fire to create complex, flavorful dishes. The people Mooking visits don't simply turn on a stove and start cooking; their methods include cooking over an open fire in a rustic chuck wagon and smoking meats in a former airplane that a mechanic has transformed into a smoker.</desc>

    <title>Cupcake Wars</title>
    <desc>In each episode, four of the country's top bakers compete for a $10,000 prize in a cupcake-baking competition. The show consists of three rounds, with one contestant eliminated after each round. In round one, the contestants must baking a cupcake that is judged on taste alone. Baking three cupcakes is the task in the second round, when they are judged on both taste and presentation. Then, the remaining two bakers are each given a five-person team in the final round, in which they have two hours to make 1,000 cupcakes. The baker who the judges determine made the best cupcakes in all three rounds takes home the cash.</desc>

    <title>Man v. Food</title>
    <desc>In one of the most popular series in Travel Channel's history, actor Casey Webb - assuming the mantle from original host Adam Richman - travels across America to sample some iconic regional dishes and take on some daunting food challenges, such as attacking a pitcher-sized bloody mary garnished with a whole fried chicken, tucking into a four-and-a-half-pound Reuben sandwich, and a choice between taking on a 151-ounce milkshake, an eight-pound sloppy joe or eating six habanero ghost chili wings. Talk about the big, the bad or the burn!</desc>

    <desc>There is, of course, much more to a vacation experience than hotels, sightseeing and souvenirs. For a look at what is literally on the menu, Travel Channel takes a tour of the must-see eateries across the country where a one-of-a-kind dining experience can be had. There are places that serve lip-smacking pizza, tasty deli entrees, boatloads of bacon, fresh seafood, finger-licking deep-fried dishes, juicy steaks, hot-and-spicy favorites - the list that can whet anyone's appetite goes on and on. Each episode focuses on a specific type of food, and there's even episodic room reserved for desserts, such as ice cream and pie.</desc>

    <desc>There's lots to do at a carnival: playing the games, riding the rides, delighting in the noise and the neon. But for some, the best part of a carnival is the food, some of it unique to that milieu. Carnival Eats targets the culinary creations linked to American fairgrounds. Calorie-loaded offerings include rattlesnake, frog legs, or okra - all deep-fried - and a decadent sundae of eight doughnuts topped with whipped cream, chocolate or caramel, and don't forget the cherry! Host Noah Cappe, a novice cook, tries his hand at making some of the items.</desc>

    <title>Carnival Eats</title>
    <desc>There's lots to do at a carnival: playing the games, riding the rides, delighting in the noise and the neon. But for some, the best part of a carnival is the food, some of it unique to that milieu. Carnival Eats targets the culinary creations linked to American fairgrounds. Calorie-loaded offerings include rattlesnake, frog legs, or okra - all deep-fried - and a decadent sundae of eight doughnuts topped with whipped cream, chocolate or caramel, and don't forget the cherry! Host Noah Cappe, a novice cook, tries his hand at making some of the items.</desc>

Whether it's smoked redfish on the half shell in New Orleans; braised short ribs in Honolulu; a Reuben omelet and French toast combo in Las Vegas; or lamb shank pie in Boston, Richman finds tasty treasures and meets, greets and eats with some of the most interesting people in America.</desc>

    <title>Carnival Eats</title>
    <desc>There's lots to do at a carnival: playing the games, riding the rides, delighting in the noise and the neon. But for some, the best part of a carnival is the food, some of it unique to that milieu. Carnival Eats targets the culinary creations linked to American fairgrounds. Calorie-loaded offerings include rattlesnake, frog legs, or okra - all deep-fried - and a decadent sundae of eight doughnuts topped with whipped cream, chocolate or caramel, and don't forget the cherry! Host Noah Cappe, a novice cook, tries his hand at making some of the items.</desc>

The chef enjoys finding inventive ways to cook with fire, which is exactly what he does in this series that takes him on a journey across the U.S. He visits pit-masters, chefs and home cooks who use fire to create complex, flavorful dishes. The people Mooking visits don't simply turn on a stove and start cooking; their methods include cooking over an open fire in a rustic chuck wagon and smoking meats in a former airplane that a mechanic has transformed into a smoker.</desc>

    <title>Food Paradise</title>
    <desc>There is, of course, much more to a vacation experience than hotels, sightseeing and souvenirs. For a look at what is literally on the menu, Travel Channel takes a tour of the must-see eateries across the country where a one-of-a-kind dining experience can be had. There are places that serve lip-smacking pizza, tasty deli entrees, boatloads of bacon, fresh seafood, finger-licking deep-fried dishes, juicy steaks, hot-and-spicy favorites - the list that can whet anyone's appetite goes on and on. Each episode focuses on a specific type of food, and there's even episodic room reserved for desserts, such as ice cream and pie.</desc>

    <desc>There's lots to do at a carnival: playing the games, riding the rides, delighting in the noise and the neon. But for some, the best part of a carnival is the food, some of it unique to that milieu. Carnival Eats targets the culinary creations linked to American fairgrounds. Calorie-loaded offerings include rattlesnake, frog legs, or okra - all deep-fried - and a decadent sundae of eight doughnuts topped with whipped cream, chocolate or caramel, and don't forget the cherry! Host Noah Cappe, a novice cook, tries his hand at making some of the items.</desc>

    <title>Burgers, Brew &amp; 'Que</title>
    <desc>Burgers, beer and barbecue are staples of many adult Americans' diets and the centerpiece of this series hosted by chef and restaurateur Michael Symon; throughout the first season, he heads to three cities across the U.S. - New York, Nashville and his native Cleveland - to discover the best each city has to offer in each of the three delicacies featured in the show - from a Nashville burger joint that creates custom dishes at diners' requests to an over-the-top barbecue joint in the Big Apple; Symon seeks out some hidden - and not-so-hidden - gems in the cities he frequents; some of his fellow Food Network personalities, including Bobby Flay and Alex Guarnaschelli, join Symon during his journeys. After Season 1, Symon broadens his scope, expanding his itinerary to add locations in more cities, including New Orleans, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Austin, Texas.</desc>

    <title>Carnival Eats</title>
    <desc>There's lots to do at a carnival: playing the games, riding the rides, delighting in the noise and the neon. But for some, the best part of a carnival is the food, some of it unique to that milieu. Carnival Eats targets the culinary creations linked to American fairgrounds. Calorie-loaded offerings include rattlesnake, frog legs, or okra - all deep-fried - and a decadent sundae of eight doughnuts topped with whipped cream, chocolate or caramel, and don't forget the cherry! Host Noah Cappe, a novice cook, tries his hand at making some of the items.</desc>

    <title>Man v. Food</title>
    <desc>In one of the most popular series in Travel Channel's history, actor Casey Webb - assuming the mantle from original host Adam Richman - travels across America to sample some iconic regional dishes and take on some daunting food challenges, such as attacking a pitcher-sized bloody mary garnished with a whole fried chicken, tucking into a four-and-a-half-pound Reuben sandwich, and a choice between taking on a 151-ounce milkshake, an eight-pound sloppy joe or eating six habanero ghost chili wings. Talk about the big, the bad or the burn!</desc>

    <desc>Equal parts smart and sardonic, creator and host Alton Brown uses a combination of classroom methods and wacky comedy sketches to explain not just how to whip up an excellent dish, but also why the ingredients interact as they do when you put them all together. Brown has said that the show's inspiration is to combine Julia Child, Mr. Wizard and &quot;Monty Python.&quot;.</desc>
