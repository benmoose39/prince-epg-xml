    <title>Carnival Eats</title>
    <desc>There's lots to do at a carnival: playing the games, riding the rides, delighting in the noise and the neon. But for some, the best part of a carnival is the food, some of it unique to that milieu. Carnival Eats targets the culinary creations linked to American fairgrounds. Calorie-loaded offerings include rattlesnake, frog legs, or okra - all deep-fried - and a decadent sundae of eight doughnuts topped with whipped cream, chocolate or caramel, and don't forget the cherry! Host Noah Cappe, a novice cook, tries his hand at making some of the items.</desc>

Extending his popular &quot;Bizarre Foods&quot; franchise, the James Beard Award-winning chef continues his quest to find the most interesting dishes around the world.
