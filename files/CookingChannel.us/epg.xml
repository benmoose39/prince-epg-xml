    <desc>There is, of course, much more to a vacation experience than hotels, sightseeing and souvenirs. For a look at what is literally on the menu, Travel Channel takes a tour of the must-see eateries across the country where a one-of-a-kind dining experience can be had. There are places that serve lip-smacking pizza, tasty deli entrees, boatloads of bacon, fresh seafood, finger-licking deep-fried dishes, juicy steaks, hot-and-spicy favorites - the list that can whet anyone's appetite goes on and on.

    <desc>In one of the most popular series in Travel Channel's history, actor Casey Webb - assuming the mantle from original host Adam Richman - travels across America to sample some iconic regional dishes and take on some daunting food challenges, such as attacking a pitcher-sized bloody mary garnished with a whole fried chicken, tucking into a four-and-a-half-pound Reuben sandwich, and a choice between taking on a 151-ounce milkshake, an eight-pound sloppy joe or eating six habanero ghost chili wings. Talk about the big, the bad or the burn!</desc>

    <title>Carnival Eats</title>
    <desc>There's lots to do at a carnival: playing the games, riding the rides, delighting in the noise and the neon. But for some, the best part of a carnival is the food, some of it unique to that milieu. Carnival Eats targets the culinary creations linked to American fairgrounds. Calorie-loaded offerings include rattlesnake, frog legs, or okra - all deep-fried - and a decadent sundae of eight doughnuts topped with whipped cream, chocolate or caramel, and don't forget the cherry! Host Noah Cappe, a novice cook, tries his hand at making some of the items.</desc>

    <title>Burgers, Brew &amp; 'Que</title>
    <desc>Burgers, beer and barbecue are staples of many adult Americans' diets and the centerpiece of this series hosted by chef and restaurateur Michael Symon; throughout the first season, he heads to three cities across the U.S. - New York, Nashville and his native Cleveland - to discover the best each city has to offer in each of the three delicacies featured in the show - from a Nashville burger joint that creates custom dishes at diners' requests to an over-the-top barbecue joint in the Big Apple; Symon seeks out some hidden - and not-so-hidden - gems in the cities he frequents; some of his fellow Food Network personalities, including Bobby Flay and Alex Guarnaschelli, join Symon during his journeys. After Season 1, Symon broadens his scope, expanding his itinerary to add locations in more cities, including New Orleans, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Austin, Texas.</desc>

    <title>Carnival Eats</title>
    <desc>There's lots to do at a carnival: playing the games, riding the rides, delighting in the noise and the neon. But for some, the best part of a carnival is the food, some of it unique to that milieu. Carnival Eats targets the culinary creations linked to American fairgrounds. Calorie-loaded offerings include rattlesnake, frog legs, or okra - all deep-fried - and a decadent sundae of eight doughnuts topped with whipped cream, chocolate or caramel, and don't forget the cherry! Host Noah Cappe, a novice cook, tries his hand at making some of the items.</desc>

    <title>Man v. Food</title>
    <desc>In one of the most popular series in Travel Channel's history, actor Casey Webb - assuming the mantle from original host Adam Richman - travels across America to sample some iconic regional dishes and take on some daunting food challenges, such as attacking a pitcher-sized bloody mary garnished with a whole fried chicken, tucking into a four-and-a-half-pound Reuben sandwich, and a choice between taking on a 151-ounce milkshake, an eight-pound sloppy joe or eating six habanero ghost chili wings. Talk about the big, the bad or the burn!</desc>
