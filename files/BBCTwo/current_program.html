His mentor is operations manager Howard Hillis, who has worked at Belfast harbour for the last 21 years. Dom is thrown in at the deep end, spending 24 hours at sea, learning the ropes alongside the captain and many of his crew, before transferring to the historic Harland & Wolff dockyards, where the Titanic was built.</div></div></div>
