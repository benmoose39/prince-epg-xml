The last two events are the women's 60m, in which Great Britain's Daryll Neita won bronze in 2023, and the ever-popular women's 4x400m relay. It is no surprise that the championships end with the relay, given that the Netherlands are the defending champions and boast superstar Femke Bol in their ranks.</div></div></div>
