Paul follows it from the Pentland Hills through a landscape steeped in myth and legend. From the picturesque and delightful Habbie's Howe, he reaches Roslin Glen, which inspired some of our greatest artists and writers - especially the mysterious Rosslyn Chapel on the cliffs above. The power of the river was later harnessed for papermaking. Paul discovers the legacy of industry before heading to ancient Musselburgh on the coast near Edinburgh.</div></div></div>
