This means motorbikes and scooters are Bermuda's most popular mode of transport. The theft of two-wheeled vehicles is a big problem. We follow officer Bryden Pedro and his partner Shandora Burrows on the trail of the bike thieves in a bid to crack down on the five motorbikes being stolen each day.</div></div></div>
