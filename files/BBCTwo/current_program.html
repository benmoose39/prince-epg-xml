On the way, Paul Murton learns how to make a haystack, speak the local 'Doric' and has a ghostly encounter with a woman in Fyvie Castle. He visits Gight Castle, the ruined home of the poet Lord Byron's family. Journey's end is at the mouth of the river where sand dunes have created Scotland's version of the Sahara.</div></div></div>
