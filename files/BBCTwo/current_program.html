Every year, six million containers from all over the world land at British ports, carrying goods that are vital to keeping the country running, making sure supermarket shelves stay stocked and factory production lines remain productive. Dom's mentor is head of operations Graeme Hardie, who has been working at the port for 25 years and before that served in the army.</div></div></div>
