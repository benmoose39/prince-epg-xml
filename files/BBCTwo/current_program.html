He learns why the health of our livestock is vital to keeping the country fed, helps to keep working animals like horses in tip-top condition, and assists the vets who provide round-the-clock care when our favourite companions are unwell. His mentor is David Black, managing director of Paragon Veterinary Group.</div></div></div>
