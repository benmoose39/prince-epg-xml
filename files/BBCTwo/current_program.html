The country is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and Mr Trump says Denmark should 'give it up' for the defence of the free world. Many people think it will never happen. But could it? If so, how? In this programme, we hear what Mr Trump has said. We gauge the reaction in Greenland and Denmark. And we ask why the US might want greater control over Greenland, and how likely it is to happen.</div></div></div>
