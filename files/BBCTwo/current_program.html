While the herds of elk and bison are gradually weakened by the cold, the park's wolves grow stronger. However, with one of the world's largest volcanoes beneath the surface, everything from the freezing cold to the creation of a snow storm is determined by the power at Yellowstone's heart.</div></div></div>
