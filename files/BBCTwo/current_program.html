On the McBrides' farm on Fairhead, Sean and his son Gerard are preparing calves for market. On the moors on Glenwherry Hill, Glenarm's head gamekeeper is leaving grit out for the grouse. In the coastal village of Cushendall, members of the Cairns estate are preparing for a Halloween fundraising event at Tiveragh allotments.</div></div></div>
