Around 2.4 million people work in the construction industry, making it one of the largest employers in the UK, and it was worth over ?100 billion in 2019 alone. Dom's mentor in London and the Midlands is area director Richard Dobson, who has been in the construction industry for the last 25 years. He'll be bolting together a brand new hospital and going back to the classroom.</div></div></div>
