His first recipe is a French classic, brioche, a buttery bread using eggs that is the easiest of bread recipes. He then goes back to basics with a French country bread recipe essential to any bakers repertoire and to finish there's a delicate yet spectacular dessert of apple croustade.</div></div></div>
