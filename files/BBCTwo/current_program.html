Swapping the studio for the road, they cruise around in an all-electric Porsche 911. Helping hands on this trip are antique gurus David Harper and Serhat Ahmet. Moira shocks and surprises David with her eclectic, unorthodox choices and haggling tactics, while Aled and Serhat find common ground with sport and music.</div></div></div>
