Many animals that live in the ocean, among them sharks, whales and turtles, must go to extraordinary lengths to survive. Tiger sharks travel hundreds of miles to feast on fledging albatross chicks and, every year, sperm whales journey from one side of the South Pacific to the other in their search of food and mates.</div></div></div>
