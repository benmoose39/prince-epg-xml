Easter Parade
Don Hewes, one half of a great dancing team, is dumped by his partner the day before the Easter parade. Wounded, Don finds himself a new partner, chorus girl Hannah Brown, who he decides to make into a star in time for the following parade. Don switches his affection easily from Nadine to Hannah, but keeps his distance so he won't be hurt again. Hannah loves Don too, but thinks he's still in love with Nadine.
