Jill Halfpenny's Easter Journeys
Jill visits the historic town of Hexham, joining bellringers in the abbey and having a go herself, and watches the Hexham Abbey choir as they rehearse a favourite Easter hymn, This Joyful Eastertide. At Corbridge Roman Town, she learns about Roman gods and goddesses and Roman links to Christianity.
