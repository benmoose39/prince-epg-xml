Chronicles of the Glens
It is autumn and the landscape is beginning to turn, as oranges, reds and browns take over from the rich green of the summer. On the McBrides' farm on Fairhead, Sean and his son Gerard are preparing calves for market. On the moors on Glenwherry Hill, Glenarm's head gamekeeper is leaving grit out for the grouse. In the coastal village of Cushendall, members of the Cairns estate are preparing for a Halloween fundraising event at Tiveragh allotments.
