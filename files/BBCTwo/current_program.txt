Highlights from Boston, with ice dance pair Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson vying to win Britain's first World Championship medal since Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean in 1984. Fear and Gibson already have three European Championship medals, including bronze at 2025's event in Estonia, but have ended fourth at each of the past two World Championships. Home favourites Madison Chock and Evan Bates will be looking to defend their ice dance title.
