Jimmy and the Wild Honey Hunters
Jimmy Doherty, pig farmer and star of `Jimmy's Farming Heroes', travels to Nepal to meet an ancient group of people who risk their lives to farm their local honey. A keen bee keeper with a passion for honey and its variety of flavours, Jimmy must scale a massive cliff to reach the home of more than 2 million bees and dangle 200 feet up to get their honey.
