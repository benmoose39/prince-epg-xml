Grand Tours of Scotland's Rivers
Paul follows the River Teviot through Teviotdale, once the haunt of notorious border reivers. In the town of Hawick, Paul joins the annual Common Riding, an event that recalls the border wars with England. In Jedburgh, close to the ruined medieval abbey, Paul is reminded of a crazy night flight by Nazi deputy leader Rudolf Hess.
