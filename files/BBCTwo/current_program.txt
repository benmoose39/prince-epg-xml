My Life at Easter with Sally Phillips
Sally Philips meets writer and broadcaster Gyles Brandreth to discover how Easter has informed a life filled with love, faith, politics and pantomime. Gyles's story takes him from family Easter egg hunts and searching for the secrets of happiness through to the paradox of combining a love of frivolity and light entertainment with a political career. For once, Gyles is lost for words as he discusses his blessings on an emotional spring walk with Sally.
