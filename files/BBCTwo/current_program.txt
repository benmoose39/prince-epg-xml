Superstar pole vaulter Mondo Duplantis is among the athletes in action in the evening session on day two of the World Athletics Indoor Championships in China. The Swedish Olympic champion, who has been in world record-breaking form once again this season, is aiming for a third successive world indoor title. Other gold medals up for grabs include the women's 60m, which was won in 2024 by St Lucia's Julien Alfred, who went on to become the Olympic 100m champion in Paris five months later.
