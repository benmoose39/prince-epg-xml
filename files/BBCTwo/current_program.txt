Will is just finishing writing `A Midsummer Night's Dream', a tale of love potions, enchantment and a wood full of fairies. He's very pleased with how realistic it is as he based it on his own experience. But Burbage and the other actors tell him it lacks a little comedy, like say a character with a funny name or a big visual joke. Meanwhile back in Will's lodgings where on earth is his servant Bottom going to put that donkey head?
