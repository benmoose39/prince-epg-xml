Leigh Leopards are vying to get their season back on track but face a tough task against Sam Burgess's in-form Warrington Wolves. Tanya Arnold presents. Adrian Lam's 2023 Challenge Cup winners have finished fifth in each of the past two Super League seasons, two places behind the Wire in the 2024 edition of the competition. Both Super League meetings last season were tight and pulsating affairs, with Warrington winning 16-14 at home before Leigh edged the reverse fixture 16-12.
