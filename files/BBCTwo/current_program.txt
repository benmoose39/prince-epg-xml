Dom Digs In
Dom lifts the lid on what really happens to Britain's waste, finding out how our non-recyclable rubbish is turned into energy to power our homes and businesses. He's up bright and early with a waste collection team before following the rubbish from our wheelie bins to a waste transfer station, where he rummages through the refuse and confirms what's recyclable and what's not.
