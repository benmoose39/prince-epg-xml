Mhairi Black: Being Me Again
When 20-year-old Mhairi Black was elected to be the member of parliament for Paisley and Renfrewshire South in 2015, she became the youngest person since the act of parliament in 1832 to take a seat in the House of Commons. As if that wasn't enough, the man she pipped to the post was former foreign secretary Douglas Alexander. She won hands down, beating him by almost 6,000 votes, and all before she had even completed her politics degree at Glasgow University.
