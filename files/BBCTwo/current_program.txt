Joanna Page's Wild Life
Joanna Page's confidence as a trainee volunteer at her local wildlife rescue centre is growing as she helps x-ray the smallest bat she's ever seen with a suspected wing fracture. Joanna also helps Alice look after and finally release some noisy garden birds. Later, she has a special moment as she releases the fox cubs who came in at the beginning of her own journey back out into the wild.
