Joanna Page's Wild Life
Actor Joanna Page helps triage two baby pigeons who have been brought in before they have even grown their feathers. She also checks over a hedgehog mum and her two hoglets, who had been brought in by a local resident. She revisits the fox cubs that she weighed as she started her training at the wildlife centre and helps take them to a soft release pen in the woods.
