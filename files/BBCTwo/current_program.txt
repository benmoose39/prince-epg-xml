Yellowstone
Winter is around the corner and there are just two months for the animals to get ready or get out. Elk move down from the mountains to find food, and beavers repair dams before ice freezes their ponds. As the snow and ice return, many animals move out from the heart of Yellowstone, away from the protection of the national park.
