Celebrity Antiques Road Trip
Reality stars Megan McKenna and James Argent take to the wheel of a sports car on a trip to Cambridgeshire and the world of antiques with experts Irita Marriott and Steven Moore. Self-confessed shopaholic Megan discovers a different kind of retail therapy and a new-found interest in the paraphernalia of 1950s midwifery. James finds that trawling antiques shops is fun and even finds himself fancying some silver spoons and a mini Napoleon.
