My Brain: After the Rupture
On a bright January morning in 2020, 38-year-old Clemency Burton-Hill -Clemmie - suffered a catastrophic brain haemorrhage. Against the odds, she emerged from a 17-day coma, but unable to speak or walk, she was faced with having to rebuild her life. Using compelling recordings from the early days of her recovery, this documentary follows Clemmie as she tries to return to her work as a broadcaster, finish the book she'd started before her brain injury, and play violin again with her son.
