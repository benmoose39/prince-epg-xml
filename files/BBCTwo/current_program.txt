Weatherman Walking
Derek-the-Weather visits the stunning village of Beddgelert in Snowdonia to walk a 6-mile circular route with awe-inspiring views. On his way he visits a copper mine, helps National Trust volunteers build a footpath and learns the heroic, but fanciful, story of a hound that gave the village its name. Meanwhile wildlife expert Lizzie Daly gets up early to photograph mountain goats and Onkar Singh Purewal lends a hand to top off a slate sculpture, inspired by the landscape.
