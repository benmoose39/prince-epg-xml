Saving Lives at Sea
Last year, the lifeboats around the UK and Ireland came to the aid of over 8,300 people. But no matter what they face when they head out on a shout, all crew members are instilled with the same philosophy: they are not there to judge. In Portrush, Northern Ireland, the crew race to rescue a boy who has gotten into difficulties while jumping off rocks. As he is battered by huge waves, and with hypothermia a real concern, one of the crew volunteers to jump into the water to try and save him.
