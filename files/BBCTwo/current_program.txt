Enya at the BBC
Sail away into the calm with this celebration of Enya, Ireland's most successful solo artist. She took the world by storm with her first single, Orinoco Flow, which stayed at the top of the UK charts for three weeks in 1988. Since then, she's released nine albums in the top ten, won multiple awards and has even had a fish named after her. Enya brought New Age music to the masses, all while maintaining her privacy, rarely giving interviews and never touring.
