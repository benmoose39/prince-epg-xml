Weatherman Walking
Weatherman Derek Brockway is in Carmarthenshire to walk along a former railway line running from Cross Hands to Llanelli. On his way he fulfils a boyhood ambition to drive a train and impresses members of the famous Tumble RFC with his kicking skills. Meanwhile biologist Lizzie Daly gets up close and personal to a massive bird of prey and astronomer Dr Jeni Millard uncovers the story of the pioneering Victorian woman who photographed the moon.
