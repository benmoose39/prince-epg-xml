Red Dwarf
Kryten experiences love at first byte when he rescues a fellow 4000-series mechanoid from a crashed vessel. Camille is everything a female mechanoid should be: she's hard, unfeeling and even has realistic toes and a slide-back sunroof head. However, Kryten soon discovers that the course of true, advanced mutual compatibility never runs in a non-glitch bug-free way.
