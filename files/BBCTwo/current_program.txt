Weatherman Walking
Weatherman Derek Brockway starts his walk in the pretty seaside town of Saundersfoot in Pembrokeshire and ends up on Pendine Sands in Carmarthenshire, famous for land-speed records. On his way he discovers the area's mining and military history, meets Amroth's oldest resident, and is serenaded by the Tenby Male Voice Choir.
