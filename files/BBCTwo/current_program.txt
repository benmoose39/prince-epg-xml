Farm to Feast: Best Menu Wins

Now the pressure ramps up as they have their culinary creativity put to the test once more. Their first challenge is designing a menu for a small dish featuring some distinctive dulse from the waters around the coastal village of Groomsport in County Down, and a large dish featuring award-winning bacon from County Fermanagh.
