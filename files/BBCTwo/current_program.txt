The Graduate
Oscar-winning story about a bewildered and unenthusiastic young man who, urged by his family to enter a business career and settle down after college, is coldly seduced by a mature woman of his parents' generation. He tries to extricate himself from the affair when he falls in love with the woman's daughter, but finds that his options may have been foreclosed by his own ill-considered conduct.
