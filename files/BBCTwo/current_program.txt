The Great Gatsby
At the centre of the story is Jay Gatsby, whose lust for money and power conceals a deeper passion, his love for Daisy, the woman he met in his early youth but lost to the bullying but wealthy Tom Buchanan. His millions made, Gatsby moves into a mansion close to Daisy, where he holds lavish parties, hoping to win her back.
