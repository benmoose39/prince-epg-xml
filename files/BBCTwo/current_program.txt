Dom Digs In
Dom tries his hand at being a zookeeper, taking a walk on the wild side at the largest zoo in the UK. His mentor is guest experience manager Gemma Bamford, who has been working at the zoo for over ten years. Running the gauntlet of big teeth, big claws and venomous predators, he also has to work surprisingly closely with a lot of dung. As he mucks in, and mucks out, he discovers that the zoo's conservation efforts are helping to make sure that many of these species survive in the wild.
