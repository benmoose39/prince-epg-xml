Forensics: The Real CSI
West Midlands Police are called when concerned neighbours report an elderly man is not responding to them at his home near Birmingham. Arriving on scene, they find harrowing evidence of forced entry to the house and discover his body face down on the living room floor. From his injuries, it is clear the man was restrained with telephone cable and endured a terrifying attack before being left to die.
