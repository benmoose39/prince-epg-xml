Policing Paradise
Bermuda's natural beauty is renowned around the world, and nowhere illustrates this more than Cooper's Island Nature Reserve on the south east tip of the island. On duty in this ecological oasis are officers Eddie Smith and Jen Ysseldyke, but during patrol they discover a car illegally parked inside this protected area. The officers eventually find the culprit, but in the process discover Officer Smith has accidentally locked the gate to the nature reserve, leaving everyone trapped inside.
