Saint Patrick: Born in Britain, Made in Ireland
Fifteen hundred years ago, a young man named Patrick embarked on an extraordinary mission that would change the course of history. Kidnapped from his wealthy Roman-British family and trafficked to Ireland, Patrick endured six years of brutal slavery. But a vision inspired his daring escape back to Britain, where he became a priest. Defying all odds, he chose to return to Ireland, a decision that would transform the island's culture and future forever.
