Raymond Blanc's Kitchen Secrets
Raymond focuses on bread and the miracle of yeast. His first recipe is a French classic, brioche, a buttery bread using eggs that is the easiest of bread recipes. He then goes back to basics with a French country bread recipe essential to any bakers repertoire and to finish there's a delicate yet spectacular dessert of apple croustade.
