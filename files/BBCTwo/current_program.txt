Ski Sunday
Ed Leigh and Chemmy Alcott are in the German town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen for the thrills and spills of the men's downhill. The team then head across the border to Courchevel, France, to catch up with the women's World Cup tour. Away from the racing, Tim Warwood meets a teenage snowboarder who, along with his family, fled his home country of Ukraine when the war broke out only to find himself on the cusp of making his first Winter Olympics at just 16 years old.
