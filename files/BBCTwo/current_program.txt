Jill Halfpenny's Easter Journeys
Jill returns to her hometown of Gateshead, visiting the world-famous Angel of the North and meeting its creator, Sir Antony Gormley, who talks to Jill about his own surprising thoughts about angels. Jill also visits the Hearts of Oak pub in Peterlee, where she rediscovers a traditional game she remembers from her youth, egg jarping. The pub brought the tradition back to life and now hosts the official world championships every Easter.
