Chronicles of the Glens
Winter can be cold and bleak in the Glens, but when the wind and blizzards subside, there is also magical beauty. It's a time for bedding in and reflection as the winter storms rage outside. At Glenarm Castle, estate manager Adrian Morrow deals with a fallen tree. The tree is hundreds of years old, and the plan is to cut in down and repurpose the wood for tables. In the walled garden, head gardener Jordan is beginning preparations for next year's tulip festival.
