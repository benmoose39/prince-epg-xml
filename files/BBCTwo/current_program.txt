Celebrity Antiques Road Trip
Used to life spent on the road, touring stand-up comedians Lloyd Griffith and Rhys James are off on a road trip around Wales and south west England. They venture through the valleys in a jazzy Jaguar e-type, accompanied by jewellery pro Hettie Jago and coin specialist Tim Medhurst. The foursome are off in search of amazing antiques and perfect punchlines. In Pontypool, Rhys makes an unusual find in the form of a picture frame-cum-radio, but is it in with a shot at auction?
