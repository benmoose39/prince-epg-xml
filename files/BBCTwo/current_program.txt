Chronicles of the Glens
It's spring, one of the warmest and sunniest on record and The Glens burst into life. On the farms there is lambing and calving to deal with, ground nesting birds are beginning to breed on the moors, and training has begun for the camogie season. But then The Glens, like the rest of Northern Ireland goes into lockdown, as the Covid-19 virus hits the UK. The programme shows how the natural spring beauty of The Glens provides a sanctuary for the inhabitants.
