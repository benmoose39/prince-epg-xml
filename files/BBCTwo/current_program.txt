Dom Digs In
Dom takes to the high seas, shepherding passengers and freight on the crucial ferry link between Northern Ireland and the UK mainland. His mentor is operations manager Howard Hillis, who has worked at Belfast harbour for the last 21 years. Dom is thrown in at the deep end, spending 24 hours at sea, learning the ropes alongside the captain and many of his crew, before transferring to the historic Harland & Wolff dockyards, where the Titanic was built.
