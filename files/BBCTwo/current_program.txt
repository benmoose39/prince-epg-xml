Great Continental Railway Journeys
In Zurich, Michael Portillo has a brush with the absurd in the anarchic paintings and artistic haunts of the Dadaists, a group of artists who found refuge in the city during the First World War. He visits the impressive Grossmunster Church to find out about the rebellious pastor at the centre of the Swiss Reformation and studies the 500-year-old Froschauer Bible, the earliest German-language bible in the world.
