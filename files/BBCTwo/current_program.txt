Comic Relief
Tom Allen and AJ Odudu continue the fundraising fun with the winner of BBC New Comedy Awards 2024 performing a very special set, the cast of the hit musical Titanique taking to the stage for an exclusive scene from the West End's funniest musical, and Sugababes returning to perform their new track alongside a medley of classics. Plus more surprises and more mayhem as Comic Relief goes late night.
