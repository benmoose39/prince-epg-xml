Celebrity Antiques Road Trip
Julie Tatchell and Amanda Middleditch head to the West Midlands on the hunt for antiques. They are assisted by antiques experts Tim Medhurst and James Braxton, who ride shotgun in a little Citroen and a huge Rolls Royce. With a ?400 budget, both celebrities need to pull on the knowledge and expertise of their companion antiquers to buy objects and collectables in antique shops that will sell for a profit at auction.
