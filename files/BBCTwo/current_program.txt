Dom Digs In
Dom rolls up his sleeves in rural Cumbria, working alongside the veterinary surgeons who ensure that our farm animals and furry friends are healthy, no matter the circumstances. He learns why the health of our livestock is vital to keeping the country fed, helps to keep working animals like horses in tip-top condition, and assists the vets who provide round-the-clock care when our favourite companions are unwell. His mentor is David Black, managing director of Paragon Veterinary Group.
