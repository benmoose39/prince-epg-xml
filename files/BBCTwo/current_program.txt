The Hairy Bikers Go North
The Hairy Bikers continue their northern odyssey in the county of Northumberland. It's an area that Si knows well, having holidayed there many times throughout his childhood, and he is keen to introduce Dave to some of the producers and chefs he has got to know over the years. Starting in the seaside town of Amble, where they eat fresh seafood from the North Sea, they head to a potato farm at the foot of the Cheviot Hills that grows nine different varieties of potato.
