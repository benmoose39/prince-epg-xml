Dom Digs In
Dom gets to work on the farm and in the factory, finding out what it takes to fill our freezers with peas, the UK's favourite frozen food. His mentor is James Hopwood, an agriculture manager for one of Britain's biggest frozen food manufacturers. In rural Yorkshire, he experiences the world of modern farming, collecting samples, walking the fields and bringing in the harvest in a state-of-the-art pea picking machine.
