Troubled Water
With exclusive access inside Thames Water, this is the story of Britain's most beleaguered water company as it battles for survival. Filmed over six make-or-break months, this episode follows the new CEO Chris Weston and his executive team as they try desperately to plug the 15 billion pound hole in the company's finances. They are months away from running out of cash. Thames says there is only one solution - a huge increase in customer bills.
