...Sings Dylan II
A feast of cover versions of Bob Dylan songs from the BBC archives, with classic tracks old and new and some surprises too from the 1960s to the present. From the essential folk queen Joan Baez to punk princess Siouxsie and the Banshees, from the Hollies to Adele, taking in the likes of Julie Felix, Richie Havens, Bryan Ferry and KT Tunstall along the way, the programme reflects Dylan's long career of writing extraordinary songs.
