Rob Brydon takes us to the Wild West where prairie dogs live in huge colonies known as `towns'. Like meerkats they are comical to watch, but there is a whole lot more to prairie dogs than just being cute - they can talk. For 30 years Professor Con Slobodchikoff has been recording their calls in response to predators and he believes he has discovered a language second only to humans in its complexity.
