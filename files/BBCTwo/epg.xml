    <desc>The Top of the Pops vaults are opened once more, this time to celebrate the mega-hits of 1982.

Step forward Adam Ant, Yazoo, Wham, ABC and the Associates, all breakthrough acts in a golden year for British pop. Madness provide a little two-step with their ska revival, and Junior and Patrice Rushen's R&amp;B tracks pack a punch.</desc>
