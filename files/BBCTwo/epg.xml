    <title>Great Barrier Reef</title>
    <desc>Amazingly, only seven percent of the Great Barrier Reef is coral and the remainder is a variety of interconnected habitats including the world's oldest jungle, hundreds of islands, mangrove swamps, mysterious deep water gardens, vast sand flats and meadows of sea grass. A giant deep-water lagoon connects all of these, and many of the creatures that live in it are almost impossibly weird.</desc>
