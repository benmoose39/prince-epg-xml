    <desc>Paul explores the lower reaches of Royal Deeside. Heading downstream, he runs aground in a canoe and then gets stuck trying to thread his body through an ancient fertility stone. In the village of Banchory, he breathes in the scent of lavender, and then takes a train along the Royal Deeside Line before heading into Aberdeen where he learns a secret recipe for the city's famous rowie - a Caledonian version of the croissant. Journey's end is on the city's famous golden sands.</desc>
