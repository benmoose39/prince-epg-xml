    <title>The Great British Sewing Bee</title>
    <desc>Sara Pascoe returns to the sewing room with 12 new hopefuls for a brand new series of The Great British Sewing Bee. In week one, judges Patrick Grant and Esme Young challenge the sewers to prove their ability to create shape. First up, the Pattern Challenge sees them crafting a tie-front blouse, using gathers to add volume. Next, in the 90-minute Transformation Challenge, circle skirts are reimagined into brand new garments.</desc>
