    <desc>Sitcom about a vicar running an inner-city church. Reverend Adam is feeling the pressure of trying to fill a rundown London church - until his congregation quadruples overnight. However, the sudden influx of worshippers isn't down to word getting out about his wonderful sermons; there's a rumour going round that the local church school is about to get a great Ofsted report.</desc>
