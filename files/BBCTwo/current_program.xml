    <title>Clive Myrie's Italian Roadtrip</title>

After spending a night in a giant wine barrel, Clive learns why prosecco is just as good as champagne from one of the country's few female winegrowers, before jumping into the navigator's seat in a 70-year-old Maserati and hunting for antiques in the hilltop town of Asolo.</desc>
