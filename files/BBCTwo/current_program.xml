    <title>Nigella: Cook, Eat, Repeat</title>
    <desc>Nigella shares her go-to celebratory cake - a divine, layered chocolate and peanut butter cake that will make even die-hard haters of peanut butter relent. She goes on to create a colourful rainbow dish of vegetables and spiced bulgur wheat, suitable for vegans, vegetarians and anyone who wants a tasty dish with minimal effort. There are some new additions to Nigella's liquorice toolbox, one of which provides the key element for a sauce to accompany her basque burnt cheesecake.</desc>
