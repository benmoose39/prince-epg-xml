    <title>Live: WA Diamond League Athletics</title>
    <desc>After a month-long break, Diamond League athletics returns in Poland as a packed stadium is expected in Silesia. Faith Kipyegon is back on the track, fresh from her attempt to become the first woman in history to run a four-minute mile. At this meet in 2024, Mondo Duplantis and Jakob Ingebrigtsen both broke world records and they return in the men's pole vault and the men's 1500m respectively, with Olympic 100m champion Julien Alfred the best of the sprinters in action.</desc>
