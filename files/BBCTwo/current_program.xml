    <title>Live: RFL Challenge Cup</title>
    <desc>Mark Chapman presents as nine-time winners Warrington take on 2023 champions Leigh in the semi-finals of rugby's iconic knockout tournament. The Wolves have been in inconsistent form this season but will attempt to reach Wembley for the second successive campaign, having lost out to all-conquering Wigan in last year's final. The Leopards won the Challenge Cup two years ago for the first time since 1971 and will take confidence from having already beaten Warrington in Super League this season.</desc>
