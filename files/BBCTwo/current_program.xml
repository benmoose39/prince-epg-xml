    <desc>Roger O Thornhill is an advertising executive mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies led by James Vandamm. Initially bemused, when he is accused of murdering a UN official he is forced to go on the run. He survives murderous attacks in both auction rooms and deserted cornfields of the Midwest, leading to one of cinema's most memorable climaxes on Mount Rushmore.</desc>
