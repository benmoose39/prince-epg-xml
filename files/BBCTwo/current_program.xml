    <desc>As Springwatch heads into week three, Chris Packham and Michaela Strachan have all the weekend drama from the wildlife cameras at the Longshaw Estate. Iolo Williams lands in Mount Stewart, the final stop of his Northern Irish road trip, where he hopes to catch a glimpse of the elusive pine marten and red squirrels that roam the site. There's also an eye-opening film about peregrine crime in the UK.</desc>
