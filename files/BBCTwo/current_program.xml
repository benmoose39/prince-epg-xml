    <title>Chronicles of the Glens</title>
    <desc>It's spring, one of the warmest and sunniest on record and The Glens burst into life. On the farms there is lambing and calving to deal with, ground nesting birds are beginning to breed on the moors, and training has begun for the camogie season.

The programme shows how the natural spring beauty of The Glens provides a sanctuary for the inhabitants.</desc>
