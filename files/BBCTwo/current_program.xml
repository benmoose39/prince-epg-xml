    <title>Weatherman Walking</title>
    <desc>Derek Brockway visits north Wales and goes into hiding, only to be tracked down by a pair of search and rescue dogs. This walk also has him heading to the hills for a coastal walk hundreds of feet up a mountain; trying his hand at golf and learning how a top secret operation near Conway played a major part in winning the Second World War. His walk takes him from the village of Abergwyngregyn to the quay at Conwy.</desc>
