    <title>Weatherman Walking</title>
    <desc>Derek, the Weatherman, is in fine voice when he kicks off his walk in Cardigan, home of the first Eisteddfod. After visiting the castle, lovingly restored by locals, he learns about the dying `art' of Seine net fishing before climbing the famous mount at Mwnt. He also gets to feed an alpaca and take tea with the WI at his final destination, Aberporth where he meets a fellow meteorologist, 98-year-old Joan.</desc>
