    <desc>A chance to see all the big moments from the men's third and final T20 clash between England and West Indies, which concludes the white-ball series between the sides. The fifth and final game of the T20 series between these sides in November 2024 was ruined by Caribbean rain, so fans will be hoping the weather in Southampton stays fair. England won that series 3-1, and with the World Cup just seven months away, they'll be keen to wrap up another victory over the two-time former world champions.</desc>
