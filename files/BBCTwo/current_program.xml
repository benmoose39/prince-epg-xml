    <title>Clive Myrie's Italian Roadtrip</title>
    <desc>As long as the water's warm, Clive loves to swim, so he's enthusiastic about taking a dip in the vast volcanic spring of Saturnia and discovering why Italians believe in the healing power of thermal water. Travelling on through Maremma - a big stretch of country running between Tuscany and Lazio - Clive stays in a treehouse at a lavender farm and learns how to extract oil from the plants.</desc>
