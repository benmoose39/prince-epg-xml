    <title>All the President's Men</title>
    <desc>Based on the Washington Post's investigation of the Watergate break-in which led to the most significant political scandal of the 1970s. With its painstaking reconstruction of the decade's political scene and tightly scripted view of the world of the newsroom, this film excitingly combines all the elements of investigative journalism with those of a tense thriller.</desc>
