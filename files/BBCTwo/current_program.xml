    <title>Nigella: Cook, Eat, Repeat</title>
    <desc>Nigella starts with a fluffy, white, no-knead bread, which she uses to sandwich her crispy fried chicken, accompanied by pickles and kimchi. Nigella then takes the fear out of making a fish stew, accompanied by a fragrant tomato base full of the warming flavours of mace, cinnamon and nutmeg. A daring dish of cherry flambe follows, using frozen cherries and kirsch, served up with her frozen cheesecake ice cream.</desc>
