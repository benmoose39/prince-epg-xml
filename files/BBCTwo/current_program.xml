    <desc>The show comes from the 19th-century Highcliffe Castle in Dorset. Christina Trevanion is joined by Philip Serrell, and they have got plenty to be looking at. Christina has fallen in love with a 1960s coat by Biba, and Philip with a classic mouseman cheeseboard. Paul Martin delves into Dorset's Bronze Age past at the Ancient Technology Centre at Cranbourne.</desc>
