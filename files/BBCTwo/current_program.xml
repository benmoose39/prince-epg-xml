    <title>Around the World in 80 Gardens</title>
    <desc>Monty Don is in South America, a continent twice the size of Europe and the home of more than 50,000 endemic plant species. In Rio de Janeiro, Monty visits the private garden of Brazil's most famous artist, Burle Marx. He views the ingenious floating gardens of the Amazon, and visits a crumbling estancia (ranch) in the windy Pampas. He ends his journey on the Pacific coast of Chile.</desc>
