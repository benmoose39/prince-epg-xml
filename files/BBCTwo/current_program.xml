    <title>Your Garden Made Perfect</title>
    <desc>Lisa and Justin live in a new-build house in Wokingham. Lisa is originally from South Africa, and the couple raised their two children there, returning to the UK a few years ago. They love their home, but the footprint downstairs isn't huge, and they are desperate to make more of the generous plot outside. Given their roots in South Africa, the family also want to connect more with nature. They go for walks in the nearby woods, but they would love their garden to offer them a `wild' experience.</desc>
