    <title>Clive Myrie's Italian Roadtrip</title>
    <desc>Clive celebrated his 40th birthday in Sicily, but like most visitors, he stuck to the beaches. Now he's travelling inland in the footsteps of his travel hero, the 19th-century African-American writer Booker T Washington. He also meets people from around the world who've bought homes in the Euro house hub of Mussomeli and discovers Italy's best street food in the island's capital, Palermo.</desc>
