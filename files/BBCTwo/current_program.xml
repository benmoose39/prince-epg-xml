    <title>Earth's Great Rivers</title>
    <desc>A pioneering exploration of the Amazon's latest discoveries and secret locations. The Amazon is by far the greatest river on earth. It is the river of superlatives, flowing more than 4,000 miles from the Andes to the Atlantic. Its 1,100 tributaries drain the greatest river basin on the planet and along its incredible journey it collects and transports one fifth of the world's fresh water.</desc>
