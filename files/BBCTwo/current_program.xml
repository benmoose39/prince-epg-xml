    <desc>When the Archdeacon tells Adam his collection plates are too light, salvation appears to come in the form of fellow priest Darren Betts, who needs a temporary venue for services whilst his own church is renovated. However, the union soon becomes a battle for hearts and minds as Darren refuses to leave Adam's church. There is tension at home too: Alex is feeling neglected and announces they need to rekindle their love life.</desc>
