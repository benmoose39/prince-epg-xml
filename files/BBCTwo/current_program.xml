    <title>Weatherman Walking</title>
    <desc>This walk is one for nature lovers. Derek Brockway's on Anglesey with its majestic cliffs constantly pounded by roaring waves. Along his walk from Porth Swtan to Cemly Bay, he visits a long house restored by locals and tries his hand at whittling. He also discovers tales of the treacherous waters and helps monitor a colony of terns on a reserve set up by an aviation hero.</desc>
