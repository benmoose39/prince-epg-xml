    <title>Weatherman Walking</title>
    <desc>Weatherman Derek Brockway strips down to basics as he crosses a nudist beach in Gwynedd. Luckily he's got a beach ball to spare his blushes! On this walk along one of Wales' most popular coastlines from Harlech to Barmouth, Derek also rolls a cheese down the world's steepest hill. He learns about the 'Devil in the Shawl' when he visits an old village chapel; nearly gets caught out on a tidal causeway; and meets a team of women who give up their free time to keep the beaches clean and safe.</desc>
