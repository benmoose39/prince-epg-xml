    <desc>Fiona Bruce and the team visit Pitzhanger Manor and Gallery in Ealing, West London, where treasures include a royal paintbox, a stylish collection of Italian jewellery, and a rare wartime medal awarded to a carrier pigeon. Frances Christie is thrilled to find a moving work by eminent 20th-century sculptor Dame Elisabeth Frink, while a couple of eerie Victorian cut-out figures, known as 'dummy boards', bring a smile to Mark Hill's face.</desc>
