    <title>Live Tennis: WTA Queen's 2025</title>
    <desc>Further live coverage from the women's event at Queen's, where the field of 32 has now been whittled down to eight - at stake for today's winners is a place in the semi-finals. The women's tournament is being held for the first time since 1973, but it has an impressive roll of honour, including Chris Evert and Britain's Ann Jones, who went on to lift the Wimbledon title a few weeks later. Presented by Isa Guha.</desc>
