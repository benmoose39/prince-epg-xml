    <title>The Bridge at Remagen</title>
    <desc>World War II film chronicling the tense battle to hold the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen, the only bridge still standing across the Rhine towards the end of the war. The German officer in charge of the region faces a dilemma - destroy the bridge and strand 50,000 of his own troops on the wrong side of the river, or leave the bridge intact and effectively give up the Fatherland to the advancing Allied forces.</desc>
