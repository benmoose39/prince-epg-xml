    <title>Great Barrier Reef</title>
    <desc>Monty Halls explores Australia's Great Barrier Reef, one of the natural wonders of the world and the largest living structure on our planet. This first film examines the complex structure of the coral reef itself and the wildlife that lives on it. So vast that it is visible from space, the reef is actually built by tiny animals in partnership with microscopic plants. It is a place full of surprises.</desc>
