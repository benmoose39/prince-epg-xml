    <title>Anna Haugh's Big Irish Food Tour</title>
    <desc>Comedian Katherine Ryan takes Anna to the foodie capital of Ireland. Katherine's memories of her grandmother's over-boiled and under-seasoned meals have left her with a bad impression of Irish food, but Anna is on a mission to change that. First stop is the world-renowned Ballymaloe Cookery School, somewhere that inspired Anna's own culinary journey, followed by a visit to one of the oldest food markets in Europe, the English Market. Will this change Katherine's mind?</desc>
