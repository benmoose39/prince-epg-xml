    <desc>Nigel Havers welcomes five more sellers to the Bidding Room, where they try to sell items to professional dealers who are on the lookout for interesting pieces, with help from expert Simon Bower. First to cartwheel through the doors are budding young actress Grace and her mum Leanne, with a gym horse. Used as a prop in a recent production of the musical, Matilda, they are selling on behalf of their local stage school to raise money for their next show.</desc>
