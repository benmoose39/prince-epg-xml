    <title>Weatherman Walking</title>
    <desc>Weatherman Derek Brockway joins the surf dudes when he visits St Bride's Bay, Pembrokeshire but still needs a bit more practice. On his walk from Little Haven to Solva he also learns about a UFO siting that stunned the world, brushes up on his life-saving skills, helps a local artist create a giant mural and is blown away by the stunning scenery.</desc>
