    <title>The Best Dishes Ever</title>
    <desc>The chefs dust down recipes that are the staples of the great British diet. These are dishes that seem to have always been around and will always be around: comforting, traditional, old school classics. The menu includes Keith Floyd's Irish Stew, the Hairy Bikers' meatloaf, James Martin's ultimate bacon butty, a good old treacle tart from Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood and a classic chili con carne from Lorraine Pascale.</desc>
