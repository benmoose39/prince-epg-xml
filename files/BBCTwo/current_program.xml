    <title>Great Barrier Reef</title>
    <desc>The Great Barrier Reef is vitally linked to the rest of the planet in many ways. Creatures travel for thousands of miles to visit in spectacular numbers, including tiger sharks, great whales, seabirds and the largest green turtle. Weather systems travelling from across the Pacific also affect the whole reef, with weather patterns and climate change likely to further shape the area and its wildlife.</desc>
