    <title>Clive Myrie's Italian Roadtrip</title>
    <desc>Famous for the ruins of Pompeii, the coastline around Mount Vesuvius has been a holiday destination since Roman times. Heading off the tourist track, Clive unearths why volcanic soil makes for the tastiest fruit and veg, learns to make Italian marmalade, uncovers the surprising royal tale behind Italy's first train line and tries his hand at carving jewellery from coral found deep beneath the sea.</desc>
