    <title>The Life of Mammals</title>
    <desc>David Attenborough looks at some of the biggest predators on Earth whose plant prey is armoured, indigestible and sometimes even poisonous. The animals examined include the sloth that lives on nothing but leaves, the rubble rabbit that makes poisons work to its advantage and even elephants who go underground to mine for salt lacking in their green diet.</desc>
