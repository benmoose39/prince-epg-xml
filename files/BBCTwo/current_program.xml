    <title>Earth's Wildest Waters: The Big Fish</title>
    <desc>The three finalists face their sixth country and their final frontier - Zambia. Navigating the immense Zambezi River, the anglers will be fishing alongside wild animals on land and in the murky water. They will be searching the croc infested waters for huge vundu catfish, fishing local style from wobbly dugout canoes and trying to catch Africa's equivalent to the piranha, the tiger fish.</desc>
