    <title>Dunkirk</title>
    <desc>A dramatic reconstruction of the World War II rout at Dunkirk. The Allied defeat and the subsequent frantic evacuation is told through the experiences of three different characters: a cockney corporal and his men separated from their unit; a newspaper reporter who moves from cool detachment to being willing to lay down his life; and a civilian whose eyes are opened by the dramatic events.</desc>
