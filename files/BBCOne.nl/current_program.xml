    <title>Garden Rescue</title>
    <desc>In Ellesmere Port, the back of James's house looks more like a building site than a garden. He is desperate for a makeover, and wants a Cornish coastal haven inspired by coastal trips to the seaside when he was a child. It also needs to be a safe space for his dog Boosh and for his two nieces, who are regular visitors. Working with a budget of ?4,500, designers Charlie Dimmock and Lee Burkhill go head-to-head to produce a design that will fulfil James's brief and win him over.</desc>
