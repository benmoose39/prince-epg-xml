    <title>The Moment of Proof</title>
    <desc>An ice pick used to stab a man in the head on the street is recovered from the roof of a pub and brings a murderer to justice. Investigators are baffled after a man is brutally killed on the street and all they have to go on is some grainy CCTV until a woman tells them she thinks her husband carried out the slaying as revenge for a drug deal that went wrong. Elsewhere, an anonymous letter throws suspicion on a man who police believe may not only be storing guns, but manufacturing his own.</desc>
