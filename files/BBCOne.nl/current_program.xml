    <desc>Dion is in Pudsey, West Yorkshire, to see an end terrace divided up into two one-bed flats. He's also in Willenhall in the West Midlands to see a three-bed end terrace bought by a first time developer. We also return to Rochdale to see a commercial building Martel first visited back in 2019.</desc>
