    <desc>Charlie Ross visits the Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds to see an impressive collection of human, horse, and elephant armour. Another battle is taking place at an antiques fair in Wetherby, waged by two teams of friends. In the red corner, it is pals Hannah and Verity, captained by Izzie Balmer. Their opponents in blue are boat fitters Giles and Huw, skippered by David Harper.</desc>
