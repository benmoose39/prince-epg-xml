    <title>Garden Rescue</title>
    <desc>Billy lives in Barnet in a period Victorian house that he loves, but he describes his garden as boring, a blank canvas with a dated broken patio. Billy dreams of a new space that fuses Victorian cottage garden with an Amazonian twist that will transport him to hotter climes without having to leave Barnet. It must have a barbecue and an entertaining area, be full of lush tropical planting and have a water feature.</desc>
