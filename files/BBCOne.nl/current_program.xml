    <desc>John Craven is in the heart of the Yorkshire Dales to tell the story of Ella Pontefract, Marie Hartley and Joan Ingilby, three pioneering women who dedicated their lives to recording the traditions, voices and skills of Yorkshire's rural communities and created a rich archive that still echoes through the Dales today. John also looks back through the archives to revisit films that echo the traditional ways of life these rural champions worked so hard to preserve.</desc>
