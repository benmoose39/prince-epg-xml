    <title>Policing Paradise</title>
    <desc>The island paradise of Bermuda is just 21 square miles, and to limit traffic congestion, locals are restricted to having just one car per household. This means motorbikes and scooters are Bermuda's most popular mode of transport. The theft of two-wheeled vehicles is a big problem. We follow officer Bryden Pedro and his partner Shandora Burrows on the trail of the bike thieves in a bid to crack down on the five motorbikes being stolen each day.</desc>
