    <title>Escape to the Country</title>
    <desc>Jules Hudson is in Derbyshire with a recently married couple, who are making an epic location shift and swapping the Blue Mountains in Australia for the wilds of the Peak District. They have a significant budget of ?750,000, and have their hearts set on a character home with a large garden for their three dogs. Elsewhere, Jules comes across an unlikely centre of manufacturing nestled in the county's rural countryside.</desc>
