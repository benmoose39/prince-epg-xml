    <title>Prayer and Reflection</title>
    <desc>Join us for the peaceful and spiritually uplifting Isha prayers from the Belfast Islamic Centre, which serves as a hub for Muslims across Northern Ireland. The prayers are the final of the five daily prayers in Islam, which take place after sunset, providing an opportunity for worshippers to reflect on their day and look ahead to the future.</desc>
