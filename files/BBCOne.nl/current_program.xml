    <desc>Stacey heads to stunning Lake Como as she's all set to launch a new product as part of her beauty brand... but this time she's also the model! It's not all plain sailing as she takes to the lake to get her 'vogue on'. But, more importantly, will she bump into local resident George Clooney? Meanwhile, Joe is left holding the fort back at Pickle Cottage. In Stacey's absence, Joe finds himself juggling kids, a long list of chores and all the animal care, so he's invited his family over to help out.</desc>
