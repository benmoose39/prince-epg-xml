    <title>Escape to the Country</title>
    <desc>Alistair Appleton meets a couple who are looking for a complete change of lifestyle in the Cumbrian countryside. Their relocation is driven by a desire to be closer to their daughter, who has already made the move there. Alistair also visits one of the region's forests and takes in some spectacular views on an exciting two-wheeled safari.</desc>
