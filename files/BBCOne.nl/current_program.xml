    <title>Bargain Hunt</title>
    <desc>Charlie Ross presides as two teams hunt for bargains at an antiques fair at Wetherby Racecourse, as civil servants Maisha and H join Izzie Balmer's reds to take on the blues of music teachers Maddy and Kirsty, skippered by David Harper. The reds are slow to buy their first item, with H being sidetracked by a fishing reel that fails to hook him in. Over with the blues, David bamboozles his duo with a history lesson.</desc>
