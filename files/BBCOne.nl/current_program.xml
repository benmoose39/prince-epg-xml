    <title>Live: WA World Athletics Championships</title>
    <desc>Coverage continues on day three of the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, with the focus turning to Mondo Duplantis in the final of the men's pole vault. He's already broken his own world record three times this season, and he's aiming for a third world title in Japan. The men's sprint hurdlers begin their campaigns for gold as well in the heats of the 110m hurdles. Can the USA's Grant Holloway defend his title despite a tricky season so far?</desc>
