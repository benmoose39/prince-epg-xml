Past pollution means only 1 per cent of women can bear children, and female criminals found to be potential mothers are put into an institution run by 'Aunt Lydia' to be indoctrinated. One such is Kate, who then seduces Fred, a higher-up in the security forces, to attempt to procreate. Fred's wife Serena, is jealous and vicious, and the State's grip seems to be tightening. But Kate still has her own mind, and is finding that some other people are prepared to resist.</desc>
