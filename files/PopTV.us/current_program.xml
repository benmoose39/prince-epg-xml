    <desc>Starting a new job can be a difficult challenge, especially if you're already retired.

Ben soon becomes popular with his younger co-workers, including Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), the boss and founder of the company. Whittaker's charm, wisdom and sense of humor help him develop a special bond and growing friendship with Jules.</desc>
