    <title>The Venture Brothers</title>
    <desc>&quot;Jonny Quest&quot; gets an irreverent but affectionate spoofing in this animated series chronicling the sometimes hair-raising adventures of Hank and Dean Venture, the not-especially-bright twin sons of pill-popping &quot;super-scientist&quot; Dr. Thaddeus &quot;Rusty&quot; Venture. Luckily (for the most part), their safety is overseen by a security guard who uses his license to kill every chance he gets.</desc>
