    <title>DIPLOMAT'S ARCHIVE: HIDDEN STORIES</title>
    <desc>As of April 2025, S. Korea has established  diplomatic relations with a total of 194 countries. Among them are countries that have had ties and  exchanges with Korea for hundreds of years. With such long-standing relationships with so many nations, might there be fascinating hidden stories between  Korea and the rest of the world that we don?t know yet?  \&quot;Diplomat?s Archives: Hidden Stories\&quot; begins with this very question. Together with foreign embassies in Korea,  the series uncovers and sheds light on meaningful  yet lesser-known stories between Korea and other countries.  Through this, we aim to reaffirm the deep friendships that  have been built over time, highlight how countries  are interconnected?bilaterally and multilaterally? and emphasize the importance of  cooperation on the global stage today.</desc>
