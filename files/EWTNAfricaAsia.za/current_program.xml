    <desc>Fr. McBride briefly sums up all he has spoken about Mary's different aspects and roles. Mary is the Mother of God, the Church, and all of us. We can count on her to help us, to guide us, and pray with us to her son. She gives herself for her Son and us so that we can be in heaven and be good on earth. (30 minutes).</desc>
