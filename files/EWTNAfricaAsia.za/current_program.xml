    <title>Catholic Church Through The Ages</title>
    <desc>Fr. Connor discusses the major events and personages of the first half of the 16th century in Europe, such as Henry VIII, Catherine of Aragon, Ss. Thomas More and John Fisher, Mary Tudor, Philip of Spain, and Elizabeth I. The Council of Trent set forth a summation of true Catholic teaching, heading the Counter Reformation with leaders such as St. Ignatius of Loyola, who sought to educate the youth in the fullness of the Faith. The 19th ecumenical council opened at Trent on 13 December, 1545, and closed there on 4 December, 1563. Its main object was the definitive determination of the doctrines of the Church in answer to the heresies of the Protestants; a further object was the execution of a thorough reform of the inner life of the Church by removing the numerous abuses that had developed in it.
