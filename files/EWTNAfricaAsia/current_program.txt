Get A Life In Christ
Fr. Groeschel looks at what we can do to help the church in these times of trouble. He starts out with an introduction about the series and then moves on to talk about "what can I do?" He talks about notions of problems identifying parts, and hints on how to be effective helping the church. In identifying the problems in the church, he looks at problems that the church faced from the dark ages until almost 100 years ago. The problems in the church goes back a long time. He briefly talks about the heresies that the church has faced throughout history. (30 minutes).
