Not coming from a liturgical or sacramental Christian experience, she experienced significant opposition from family who thought she was making a huge mistake and overcomplicating Christianity with rituals and external piety. 

She shares some of the ways she prayed and discerned through that process, and how she and her husband eventually moved together toward full communion with the Catholic Church. (60 minutes).</div></div></div>
