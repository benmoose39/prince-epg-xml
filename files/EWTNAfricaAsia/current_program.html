Her love for and study of the ?Great Books? of history helped further point her toward Catholic ideas, and meeting her husband, who was going through the same kind of awakening of faith, was a crucial step in her decision to enter the Catholic Church. She now uses her gifts as a writer and editor of novels and other forms of literature. (60 minutes).</div></div></div>
