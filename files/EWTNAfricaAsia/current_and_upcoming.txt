Nig?ria: Coexistence
Dans la Middle Belt (r?gion du milieu) du Nig?ria, le conflit entre agriculteurs chr?tiens et ?leveurs musulmans s'est intensifi? au fil des ans. Les changements climatiques ont affect? les cycles de r?colte et la disponibilit? d?eau dans la r?gion. Les bergers avaient l'habitude d'amener leur b?tail dans les champs r?cemment cultiv?s pour nourrir les animaux avec les r?sidus de r?colte et pour fertiliser naturellement la terre. Mais des saisons des pluies impr?visibles ont forc? les ?leveurs de b?tail ? se d?placer plus au sud, provoquant la destruction des champs cultiv?s. Les bergers de la tribu Fulani sont pour la plupart musulmans, tandis que les agriculteurs appartiennent en g?n?ral ? diff?rentes confessions chr?tiennes. Le groupe terroriste Boko Haram a sem? le ressentiment et la ranc?ur entre ces deux groupes, provoquant une vague sans fin d?actes de vengeance et de repr?sailles violentes qui ont laiss? un cort?ge de morts et de destructions. Voici l'histoire des membres des deux groupes qui tentent de r?parer les liens bris?s et de r?tablir une coexistence pacifique. (30 minutes).
