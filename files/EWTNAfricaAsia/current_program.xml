    <desc>Fr, Benedict is developing the theme over several episodes of the gift of the virtues being powers afforded us from God.  This episode is devoted to his discussion of &quot;Whatever Happened to Virtue?&quot;  It is no longer politically correct to be virtuous and, of course, Fr. Benedict takes exception to that position. (30 minutes).</desc>
