    <title>Zambia, Dj Baza</title>
    <desc>The strength of radio in Africa is in its ability to reach the most remote villages in a continent where infrastructure is poor and electricity intermittent. In the town of Livingstone in Zambia, there is a leading Catholic station called Radio Musi-o-Tunya, run by a Catholic nun. The documentary follows the story of trainee journalist DJ Baza as he hones his skills covering stories ranging from rap artists to the impact of unregulated mining on the health of local people.
