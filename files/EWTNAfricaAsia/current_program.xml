    <title>Syria, In The Middle Of Ashes</title>
    <desc>The battle for Aleppo was one of the deadliest in the war in Syria. Aleppo is a microcosm of the war that devastated the country. Out of a population of 18 million people, more than 13 million are in need of humanitarian assistance. Children are most at risk and in distress, suffering from disease and malnutrition, forced to work, marrying early, subjected to abuse and forced to become child soldiers. In the midst of this humanitarian crisis, Christians are suffering twice: from the general instability caused by the war and from targeted attacks on Christian communities by jihadist militants determined to eradicate the Christian presence.
