    <title>Venezuela, Vignettes Of The Orenoco Mission</title>
    <desc>The Orinoco is one of the most important rivers in South America. It originates in Venezuela and mainly crosses this country with the third largest water flow in the world before reaching the Atlantic in the state of Delta Amacuro. This state is the second least populated in Venezuela, which is easy to understand since most of its more than 40,000 square kilometers is just water and forest. Capuchin missionaries arrived in the early 20th century and established the first missionary center, Mission de Caron?, in Araguaimujo, in 1925. Many of those who reached first died of malaria and yellow fever. Of the missionaries who arrived in the 1950s, few are still alive; however, new missionaries have arrived and others continue to arrive to support the work of evangelism. (30 minutes).</desc>
