    <desc>This episode is on the virtue of prudence.  Father claims that it is a virtue that many Americans do not appreciate, nor do we cultivate it.  He claims that we like wild and crazy activities and avoid the prudent path.  He also points out what we loose as a nation by not cultivating this virtue. (30 minutes).</desc>
