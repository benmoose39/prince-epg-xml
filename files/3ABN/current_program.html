The relations between God and each soul are as distinct and full as though there were not another soul upon the Earth, (SC, 100). He's seeking out His people, He's seeking out His lost ones, He's seeking out you. Join us and find direction again; find comfort in His word again. Learn with us how to find God's will, how to find perfection, and how love God more.</div></div></div>
