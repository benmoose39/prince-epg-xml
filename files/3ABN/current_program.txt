3ABN Today
Join this special 3ABN Today as the special guest shares drifting from faith to chase football dreams and spending 25 years far from God, even as his mother prays for his return. Through life's trials he finds his way back to the SDA church, bringing his wife along with him, and fully committing to God just before his mother's passing. Tune in as our guest reflects on the powerful moments where God's hand was unmistakably guiding him back home.
