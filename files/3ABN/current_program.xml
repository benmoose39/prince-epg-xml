    <desc>Success should be defined by our faithfulness and obedience to the Lord. Success will be defined when the forthcoming events prove whether our hearts were of stone or of flesh. We do not belong to Christ unless we are His wholly. The effort to serve both self and Christ makes one a stony-ground hearer, and he will not endure when the test comes upon him, (COL, 50). Let us allow our Rock and our Salvation to work in us. Keep it pure.</desc>
