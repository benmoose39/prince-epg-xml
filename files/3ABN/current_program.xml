    <desc>I don't like this title! Why? Because I don't like for Satan to be satisfied and neither should YOU! Because for him to be satisfied it means that he has a hold on people and claims them as his. Satan is satisfied when a person claims conversion but there is no real character change in their life. Satan is satisfied when we fail to study our Bibles to show ourselves approved unto God. Satan is satisfied when we do NOT put biblical laws and principles into daily action.</desc>
