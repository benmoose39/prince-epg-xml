    <desc>All of history is moving to one grand, glorious climax: the coming of Jesus. Soon the great controversy between good and evil will be over. Soon sin and suffering will end. Soon disaster, disease, and death will be no more. Soon peace, joy, and love will replace all our sorrows and our tears will be wiped away forever. In this inspiring presentation, Pastor Finley shares that Jesus wants you in heaven even more than you want to be there.</desc>
