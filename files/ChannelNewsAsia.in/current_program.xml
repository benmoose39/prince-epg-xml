    <title>Addicted</title>
    <desc>Much like &quot;Intervention&quot; on A&amp;E Network, this hourlong docu-series chronicles the lives of people struggling with substance abuse. Each episode focuses on one person or couple's unpredictable journey toward recovery, helped by interventionist Kristina Wandzilak, herself a recovering addict. The addictions that the subjects try to overcome include addictions to meth, alcohol and heroin. Kristina tries to help the addicts overcome their addictions to get their lives back on track and, in some cases, reunited with loved ones.</desc>
