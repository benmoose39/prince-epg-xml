    <title>Bro's in Control</title>
    <desc>Callum is a Little Bro in control! His Big Bro Adam?s going head-to-head against best mate Joe in some funny, gungy and gross challenges: who?ll take the win, and who?ll take on a forfeit from the Wheel Of Doom? Callum isn?t taking any nonsense so they have to work hard to impress him! When animal costumes turn up at their door, Joe and Adam know another messy, wild challenge from Little Bro Callum?s about to begin. Can Adam?s dung beetle take on Joe?s kangaroo and win? Will Joe?s bumblebee emerge victorious against Adam?s spider? Both want to swipe the win and avoid a forfeit from Wheel of Doom, but only one top dog can claw their way to success. Who will it be.</desc>
