    <title>Operation Ouch!</title>
    <desc>Dr Chris inserts a special medical tube into Dr Xand's nose and down to his belly to prove that the nose, mouth and stomach are all connected. Dr Xand takes things to the extreme as he endures a room colder than Antarctica to find out how our bodies cope in freezing temperatures. And Dr Chris is in the operating theatre to see an incredible robot surgeon perform a real-life surgery. Meanwhile, over in accident and emergency, one patient has a broken elbow after a game of leapfrog goes horribly wrong, and another has managed to get a stone stuck in his ear.</desc>
