    <title>Boy Girl Dog Cat Mouse Cheese</title>
    <desc>Mouse is bored of always doing the same things the same way, so Girl suggests he starts thinking outside the box and lives his life differently. Boy and Dog don?t agree, but Mouse, Cat and Cheese follow Girl's lead and it's fun! But when things get out of control, Girl turns to Boy and Dog for help getting things back to normal. With so much chaos in the house, maybe it's time everyone lives back inside the box again.</desc>
