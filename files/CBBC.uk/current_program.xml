    <title>So Awkward</title>
    <desc>Lily finds a diary in Mugshotsz which is all about the owner's dream girl, beside a photo of Lily surrounded by love hearts. This confirms it - Lily must be the secret crush. When head boy of Cranmede, Hunter Phillips, turns up to claim his diary, Lily can't believe it. Thrown by how tall and handsome Hunter is, Lily has to remind herself she has a boyfriend. How can she let Hunter down without smashing his heart to bits? It?s Amazing Women Who Changed the World week. Martha and Kat compete to have a statue of their chosen Amazing Woman erected in the school. Whoever has the most signatures, wins. Kat champions Karren Brady and Martha champions physicist Ida Noddack. Still believing Hunter has a crush on her and in front of Rob, Lily tell Hunter that his 'crush' will never go out with him. Hunter thinks she means Martha and given how angry Martha is with him, he is forced to agree with Lily.</desc>
