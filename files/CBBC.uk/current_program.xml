    <title>The Next Step</title>
    <desc>A reality-style drama following the lives of a group of dancers at the Next Step Dance Studio as they attempt to win the regional dance championships. On their day off, some of the dancers go to the beach while Emily and the E-Girls run the studio's dance camp. Everything is going as planned at the studio until one of the young dancers decides to pull a prank. Meanwhile at the beach, Riley loses Emily's favourite necklace and enlists the rest of the dancers to help her find it.</desc>
