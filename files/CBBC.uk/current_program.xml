    <title>Deadly 60</title>
    <desc>With his crew in tow, Steve is on a mission to find all the animals that most Africans spend as much time as possible avoiding. Steve braves the big waves of the Durban coast to get up close and personal with a pack of 30 hungry blacktip sharks, getting a bit too close for comfort. After swimming in shark-infested waters, Steve abseils down to a nest of killer bees with a painful outcome. An eerily close encounter with a ragged tooth shark is followed by getting airborne with the awesome black eagle. Unlike Rourke the eagle, Steve comes down to earth with a bump.</desc>
