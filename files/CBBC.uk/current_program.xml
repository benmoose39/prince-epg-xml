    <title>Deadly Mission Shark</title>
    <desc>In this episode, part of the team explores the mangroves, which are essential for the survival of some sharks. While there, they come face to face with baby lemon sharks. Back on dry land, the rest of the team are learning more about North Bimini?s main tourist area ? Alice Town. It?s a chance for the shark saviours to relax, see the sights and play a quick game of frisbee on the beach before everyone reunites for the next phase of their training.</desc>
