    <title>Cooking Buddies</title>
    <desc>Kicking off the series in Buddy?s den, the gloves are on as Buddy and Conker are joined by Jackson, a young boxer who wants to learn a recipe that can pack a punch to keep his energy up! Buddy knows that Jackson loves a big-stacked sandwich, so what better than a homemade fish finger sandwich topped with crunchy lettuce and a simple two-ingredient delicious sauce, all packed into a soft bun?! Learning to cook means that you can make your meals exactly how you like them, so Jackson chooses to use cod and Buddy uses salmon, and things get messy when they breadcrumb the fish! Taking time out from the kitchen, Buddy is kept on his toes by Jackson as he gives him a lesson in boxing. Buddy learns to be light on his feet, throw a punch and read his opponent? Join Buddy, Conker and Jackson in this tasty episode of Cooking Buddies that certainly packs a punch! You can get all of Buddy?s recipes, and LOADS more, at bbc.co.uk\/food.</desc>
