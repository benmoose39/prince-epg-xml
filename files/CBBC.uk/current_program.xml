    <title>One Zoo Three</title>
    <desc>It?s a busy day for Cam, Tyler and Aaron as it?s time to give some of the zoo's animals a thorough health check. Cam gets a close-up view of Kassanga the African lion?s clever claws, while black jaguar cub Inka needs some extra encouragement before getting stuck into a big pile of leaves. Tyler helps keep Eurasian lynx Petra's coat in perfect condition, and Aaron discovers Baikal the white tiger has a problem with his tooth.</desc>
