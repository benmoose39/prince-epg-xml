    <title>Deadly 60</title>
    <desc>Steve Backshall and his long-suffering crew return for a series of deadly encounters with animals hoping to earn a place on his hallowed Deadly 60 list. Steve and the team are in the jungles of Costa Rica. On his search for the Deadly 60, Steve gets strangled by a giant boa, is struck dumb by the strike speed of a viper, and plays hide-and-seek with a deadly bushmaster. As if that wasn't enough, he gets hands-on with a poisonous frog - and nearly gets a nip from a blood-sucking vampire.</desc>
