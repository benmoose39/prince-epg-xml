    <desc>Eleven-year-old Yusuf has hemiplegia, which means he has a weakness down one side of his body. But he doesn't let it stop him doing what he loves, computer coding. He also dreams of being in the army and hopes to one day bring these two loves together to become an army intelligence officer. Yusuf needs an Army Coding Den where he can code to his heart's content and make his army dreams come true.</desc>
