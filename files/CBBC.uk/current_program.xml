    <desc>Cam, Tyler and Aaron are at the cat sanctuary helping keeper Briony prepare for the arrival of Luka, an extremely rare Amur leopard. Will the sanctuary?s resident Amur leopard, Xizi, be equally excited with her new partner? Aaron gives Shen, the recently born snow leopard cub, his first health check and helps Tyler prepare a tall, meaty task for Kedera the jaguar - but will she rise to the challenge? Who will be triumphant as the brothers put Aaron to the test with more wildlife wonders? Tyler is sharpening his sniffing senses with a bird poo challenge, and we discover how to tell the real difference between a snake and a lizard! In Uganda, the brothers help a conservation project return some rescued marsh terrapins back into the wild.</desc>
