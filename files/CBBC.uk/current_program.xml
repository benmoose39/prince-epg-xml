    <desc>Eleven-year-old Cammy is one of six siblings. You'd think that would be reason enough for him to deserve his own space, but Cammy also has Sensory Processing Disorder. Sometimes the bustle of his busy family home is too much for him, and when he gets agitated he knows it's too much for his siblings. He thinks they need a break from him as much as he needs a break from them. Cammy's SPD means he can be oversensitive to certain sounds, smells, textures and flavours. He needs a place where he can be on his own, in calm and quiet to let his senses relax.</desc>
