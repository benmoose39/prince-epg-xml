    <desc>This Halloween is the spookiest ever for Arthur and friends. While trick-or-treating, Francine meets an old woman with a mysterious past, while Binky finds himself at Mr Ratburn?s house. Muffy and Bailey decide to cut through a dark, rainy cemetery. And as for Arthur, Buster and Ladonna, their treehouse sleepover seems to be haunted... by a little sister and brother.</desc>
