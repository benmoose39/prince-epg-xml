    <title>The Dengineers</title>
    <desc>Daisy, eight, has type one diabetes and has an insulin pump attached to her 24 hours a day. This doesn't stop her doing her favourite thing - sewing! When she is not at her sewing club, her sewing machine is out and she is designing and making her own creations... until dinner time that is! She has to pack everything away so the family can eat at the table. Daisy needs a sewing den where she can create fabulous designs in peace.</desc>
