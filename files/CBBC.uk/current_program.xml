    <title>Danny and Mick</title>
    <desc>Joy has a new fitness device for Danny and Mick and wants to test them out to see if they are as fit as they should be. When Lance gets in on the action she decides to make a competition with a prize for the contestant who does the most steps by the end of the day. Mick takes it very seriously indeed, Lance is confident he will win and Danny comes up with more and more imaginative ways to cheat. Come closing time it's anyone's guess who has put their best foot forward.</desc>
