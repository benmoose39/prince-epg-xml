    <title>The Dengineers</title>
    <desc>Eight-year-old Oscar has lived most of his life in the Australian outback where he had an amazing time dirt biking, camping and playing outside. He and his family moved to Ayr a few years ago and while he has made good friends and likes living there, he misses his old outback life. He wants an Australia den so he can remember his hometown and where he can share his memories with his new friends.</desc>
