    <title>Snuff</title>
    <desc>A tale from Quentin Blake's Box of Treasures. Village knight Sir Thomas Magpie, well known for both his generosity and love of flamboyant hats, despairs that his clumsy page Snuff will ever learn the tricky skills he needs to one day be a knight himself. However, when four thieves threaten to raid a local bootmaker?s shop, Snuff has a clever idea to outfox the villains and save the day. His reward? His very own horse and fancy hat, just like a proper knight.</desc>
