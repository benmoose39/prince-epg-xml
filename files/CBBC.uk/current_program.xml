    <title>Operation Ouch!</title>
    <desc>The doctors reveal what makes you flexible as they test the incredible strength of a tendon to the max, and they find out what it's like to be an air ambulance pilot in Operation Takeover. Dr Xand uncovers if laughter really is the best medicine, and we meet the first of our Ouch Patients to find out what it's like to be a regular hospital patient. Meanwhile, in accident and emergency, one patient has surgery to fix a leaking bone graft, while another is treated for a dancing injury.</desc>
