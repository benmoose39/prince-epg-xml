    <title>The Dengineers</title>
    <desc>Eleven-year-old Philip has a digestive condition that means he's always in pain. Sometimes the pain is low enough that he can play sport but often it's bad, and he has to miss school and not play with his friends. When he can't go out he makes model planes and is fascinated by the RAF and the history of the Second World War. We're giving Philip his very own plane den, where he can go whenever he wants, even if he's feeling ill, where he'll be surrounded by his favourite things.</desc>
