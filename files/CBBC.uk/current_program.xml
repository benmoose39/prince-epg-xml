    <title>Horrible Histories</title>
    <desc>A special episode of the historical sketch show, focusing on the great British queen Boudica, starring Lorna Watson from Watson &amp; Oliver. We follow Boudica as she turns against her Roman masters and unleashes her wrecking ball on Colchester, St Albans and London. It is cut-throat Celts versus rotten Romans - it is going to be very gory! Meanwhile, across the world, we meet famous emperors Caligula and Nero dishing out their own unique brand of imperial nastiness. With of course, our host Rattus to guide the way.</desc>
