    <desc>There?s a horrible snotty fever going around the leisure centre and it?s catching fast. To make matters worse it?s the day of the gymnastics competition. When the Pottsfield?s team get snotty it looks like their chances of winning anything are gone. However, Danny and Mick won?t let that happen - it?s time to jump into a leotard and show everyone what they?ve got.</desc>
