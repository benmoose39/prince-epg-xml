    <desc>The One Zoo Three brothers are on a mission to compose a zoo musical using the sounds of the animals. Lar gibbons Shany and Raff swing into action and audition to be the perfect percussionists, while a health check with Bombura the loud kookaburra sees him in with a shout for lead vocals. Even playful jaguar cub Inka proves she can add a cracking big crunch to the mix! Meanwhile, Aaron reveals some facts about Darwin the hornbill?s hidden talents, Tyler takes on a breathtaking challenge with an anaconda, and the brothers recall their conservation travels to Uganda to see how rangers are helping protect the African elephant population.</desc>
