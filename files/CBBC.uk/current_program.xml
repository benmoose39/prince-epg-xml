    <title>Deadly Dinosaurs with Steve Backshall</title>
    <desc>Steve is on a mission to unearth the sneaky dinosaurs that were far deadlier than they first appeared! We're learning new things about even the most notorious dinosaurs, and first up, Steve meets Sinornithosaurus - a dinosaur hiding a deadly dental secret. He then races a velociraptor in a climbing challenge, with a surprising result. Finally, Steve puts Argentinasaurus to the ultimate test to see how earth-shattering its stamp really was.</desc>
