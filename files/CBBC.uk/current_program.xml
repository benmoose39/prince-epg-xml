    <title>Cooking Buddies</title>
    <desc>Buddy and Conker get a call from Sienna, a footballer who needs Buddy?s help. Her grandparents? wedding anniversary is coming up and she wants to cook something to surprise them. Buddy knows that making pizzas from scratch is bound to score well with everyone, so they make their own dough and tomato sauce, and choose their own toppings to make personalised pizzas (with faces!) that everyone will love. This time, Conker also has a playmate as Sienna brings her little pug, Bella with her. Conker tries to impress Bella with his jokes as they both cheer Buddy and Sienna on! Taking a break from their ?Keepy Uppy Pizzas?, Sienna drills Buddy on the football pitch, challenging his fitness by racing him with parachutes on their backs, dribbling to test his control of the ball and learning to do rainbow flicks, before going into the ultimate penalty shootout. Join Buddy, Conker, Sienna and Bella in this fun and tasty episode of Cooking Buddies that scores big. You can get all of Buddy?s recipes, and LOADS more, at bbc.co.uk\/food.</desc>
