    <title>Horrible Histories</title>
    <desc>A special episode about Mary, Queen of Scots, starring Jessica Ransom. It follows the young Mary as she stumbles from being a young girl in Scotland to queen in France, back to queen in Scotland and finally to Elizabeth I's public enemy number one - with a bit of Queenian Rhapsody thrown in for good measure! Meanwhile, across the world, we meet silver-nosed Danish scientist Tycho Brahe, and Mr H gives us his unique take on the epic Battle of Lepanto in another History's Craziest Fools. With, of course, our host Rattus to guide the way.</desc>
