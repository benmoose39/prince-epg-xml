    <desc>The OZT brothers are on an adventure to take a closer look at some of Britain's threatened grassland animals. Aaron and Cam go off-road in a bumpy dash across the wilds of Exmoor to try and gather more than 100 semi-wild ponies off the moor for their annual health check. Cam meets 12-year-old wildlife hero and butterfly champion Rebecca to find out why she is so fascinated with butterflies. Meanwhile, Tyler heads to the Forest of Dean to team up with ?the snake whisperer?, on a mission to track down an adder, one of our most secretive and threatened snakes. In the heart of mid Wales, Aaron meets a wildlife hero who has played a big part in the recent success story of the red kite, and he is blown away when hundreds of red kites fill the sky. Back at OZT HQ, Cam gets his hands on the latest wildlife filming kit to give us the low-down on how the incredible shots of high-jumping hares were filmed in Sir David Attenborough?s Wild Isles series. Aaron is put to the test with some quickfire questions from the OZT crew in Ask Aaron, and the OZT Gallery puts viewers? wonderful wildlife pictures in the frame.</desc>
