    <title>One Zoo Three</title>
    <desc>The One Zoo Three brothers explore San Diego Zoo Safari Park in the US and come face to face with rhinos, giraffes and the California condor. Tyler is faced with one of the biggest piles of poo he he has ever seen while on the trail of a crash of white rhinos. But this is no ordinary mountain of muck ? Tyler discovers the importance of a rhino loo and what these animals can do with a pile of poo! Meanwhile, Aaron is lucky enough to go behind the scenes at the safari park?s special lab, where he discovers how the latest science is being used to bring back certain species, such as the beautiful Przewalski?s horse, from the brink of extinction, . Cam has a unique opportunity to look at a California condor chick inside an egg and to hand-feed a young lappet-faced vulture, with the help of an unusual puppet. Cute Alert introduces an adorable little beauty who lives up high in the branches ? Som, the Matschie?s tree-kangaroo. And Aaron sticks his neck out to reveal some real wows and wonders about the giraffe ?- but are they fact or fake.</desc>
