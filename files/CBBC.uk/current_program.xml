    <title>Deadly 60</title>
    <desc>It doesn't get deadlier than big game country - Steve is hot on the trail of Africa's big cats. He dons a camouflage suit to beat a leopard at its own game by hunting his crew, but it proves to be a lot harder than it looks. Nevertheless a once-in-a-lifetime experience gets him closer to a wild leopard than even he'd dare hope. After an eerie night sleeping out under the stars, Steve catches up with a pride of lions and witnesses them hunting right before his eyes, proving just how deadly lions are. Deadlier still when they start stalking him and his crew late at night.</desc>
