    <title>Horrible Histories</title>
    <desc>A special episode about William the Conqueror, starring Kevin Eldon. We meet young William, Duke of Normandy, as he quarrels with Harold Godwinson about who should be king of England, before bashing the English and taking the crown at the famous Battle of Hastings in 1066! Meanwhile, across the world, we discover Chinese technology light years ahead of the dunderheaded Normans and Saxons in England, and meet one of the world's first scientists in Egypt. With, of course, our host Rattus to guide the way.</desc>
