    <title>Shark Bites</title>
    <desc>Steve Backshall meets the most colossal shark in our seas. Measuring up to a record 18 metres, the whale shark is not only the largest shark, but the largest fish in the world. Steve dives with this gargantuan shark off the coast of Mozambique in Africa and reveals their somewhat surprising diet, before heading into his shark lab to get under their skin and reveal how they manage to filter their food from the water.</desc>
