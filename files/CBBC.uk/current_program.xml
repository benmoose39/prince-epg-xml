    <title>Dennis &amp; Gnasher Unleashed!</title>
    <desc>It's the famous Beanotown Freewheeler Derby! During practice, the gang realize Walter's go-kart is especially speedy. Worried that Walter will beat his record, Dennis creates a lighter, faster kart but loses control and injures himself. It is up to Rubi's wheelchair know-how and Dennis' super-speedy karting skills to win the race.</desc>
