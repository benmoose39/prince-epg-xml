    <title>Horrible Histories</title>
    <desc>A special episode of the historical sketch show about King George III. We follow George from a young unpopular king to a much-loved figure some 60 years later, and check out a bit of his court life along the way. Meanwhile, across the world we hear about some of the words we have got from India, while the Battles of the Day team give us their unique insight into the American Revolution. With, of course, our host Rattus to guide the way.</desc>
