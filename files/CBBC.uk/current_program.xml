    <title>Horrible Histories</title>
    <desc>Horrible Histories favourite Death, of 'Stupid Deaths' fame, presents his very own show crammed full of spooky highlights. We join him at home and get a good look around as he reveals his creepiest moments - a Tudor family show us the extent of their ghostly superstitions and the Vikings demonstrate how to become truly terrifying to your enemies. Death himself is joined by some rather creepy friends to sing about his favourite scary things.</desc>
