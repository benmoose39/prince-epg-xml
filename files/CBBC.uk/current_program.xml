    <title>The Next Step</title>
    <desc>A reality-style drama following the lives of a group of dancers at the Next Step Dance Studio as they attempt to win the regional dance championships. With Daniel now out of A-troupe, Michelle and the team try and get Emily to come back. James is given Daniel's solo but can't seem to balance both maths and dance. Riley and West worry he may get pulled out of the studio for good.</desc>
