    <desc>The last thing DM would normally want to do is play a boring board game, but when one arrives in the post, it releases knockout gas and he's surprised to wake up in the town of Greenback. Jeopardy Mouse, Hazard Mouse and Danger Cash have also been snatched and are equally clueless why until a dragon attacks the group and a net drops from the sky at an opportune moment. Our guys realise they have been shrunk to chess-piece size by Ian the Danger Fan and are now pawns in his real-life board game.</desc>
