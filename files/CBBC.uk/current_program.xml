    <title>Cooking Buddies</title>
    <desc>Buddy and Conker are joined by Taye, a young street artist who wants to make a surprise birthday meal for his dad, who loves crispy chicken. Together, they make the crispiest, most delicious fried chicken, served up with homemade slaw, potato wedges and corn on the cob in what must be the best birthday present ever! In return for Buddy?s help, Taye shares some of his artistic skills and shows him how to create his very own bubble-writing signature. Join Buddy, Conker and Taye as they create a work of art both on paper and on a plate with a great homemade takeaway! You can get all of Buddy?s recipes, and loads more, at bbc.co.uk\/food.</desc>
