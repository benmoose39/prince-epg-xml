    <title>So Awkward</title>
    <desc>Lily gets a part-time job waitressing at Mugshotsz Caf?, determined to prove to straight-talking owner Lou that teenagers make good workers. However, her mission goes wrong when Jas gets a job at the caf? too. Jas is messy and thoughtless, which upends Lily?s need for perfection, yet Lou thinks Jas is brilliant. Meanwhile, Sid has been invited to audition for a performing arts college. Rob is upset that Sid may leave Cranmede, and Mr Malone is annoyed that his free guitar lessons will end. Torn between going to the audition or not, Sid turns to Jas for advice. Ollie has a girlfriend, Kat, which Martha finds nauseating. She is unnerved that Kat attends Cranmede, has persuaded Ollie to set up a tech company with her, and worse still, has taken Martha?s seat in the caf?, forcing her to sit away from the power socket.</desc>
