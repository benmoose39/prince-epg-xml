    <title>Game on Grandparents</title>
    <desc>Game on Grandparents, presented by eSports host, Julia Hardy is a gaming competition series like no other. With lots of laughs along the way, young gamers and their grandparents step in to each other?s lives like never before. Girls and boys who dream of playing at an eSports tournament are about to get the chance BUT there's a twist: they won't be playing themselves, they have to train their Gran or Grandad! And while their grandparents are busy practising, the children have to take on their roles about the house from washing up to walking the dog, to entertaining Grandma?s friends for the afternoon ? what could possibly go wrong?! In this episode its snow days all round as Kai and gran Karen take on Oscar and Granddad John in a Wii ski contest to challenge them like they?ve never been before. But how will they get on at a real snow slope when the grandparents (dressed in lycra, of course!) go head-to-head in a sledging race? And which team will be the fastest in the arena to go through to the grand final.</desc>
