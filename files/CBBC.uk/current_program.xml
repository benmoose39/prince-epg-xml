    <title>The Dengineers</title>
    <desc>Community on Solid Ground is a youth centre in Whalley Range. Before they took over the building the area didn't offer much for the youngsters living there and antisocial behaviour was very common. That has dropped by 73 per cent since Community on Solid Ground came along, the kids can hang out, play sports and have a place to go that means they aren't hanging around the streets. Sadly the facilities are very tired, and they don't have areas they can play their beloved sport on. The Dengineers are going to transform their outside space into a sports arena worthy of the Olympics... well, nearly.</desc>
