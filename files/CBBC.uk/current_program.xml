    <title>Deadly Mission Shark</title>
    <desc>In this episode, the team journey to Rainbow Reef, where they face their next dive tasks. With some still struggling, there?s a long way to go. With training over, and the team split up, Steve takes some for a shallow-water shark experience with the timid black tips, a perfect shark for novices. Meanwhile, Skyla, one of the Bahamian shark saviours, persuades the rest of the UK team to join her rehearsals for the annual Junkanoo, one of the Caribbean's most celebrated carnivals.</desc>
