    <title>Boy Girl Dog Cat Mouse Cheese</title>
    <desc>Dog decides to show the family that he can be as tough as the wolves they are watching on TV. He joins a gang of street dogs and soon becomes leader of the pack. Meanwhile, the rest of the kids worry when Dog doesn?t come home and go out looking for him. However, they find that he is now too cool to be part of the 'old' family - until he is forced to make a choice between loyalty to the pack and loyalty to his best friend Boy.</desc>
