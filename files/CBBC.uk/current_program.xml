    <title>Shark Bites</title>
    <desc>This time on Shark Bites, Steve Backshall meets a night-time ninja. The whitetip reef shark has a cool and calm character by day, but after dark they turn into highly honed hunters. Scouring the reef, they search out prey that's hiding away in coral caves. Steve gets a closer look at them off the coast of Malaysian Borneo and gets under their skin in his Shark Lab to explain how they can fit where other sharks can't.</desc>
