    <title>Cooking Buddies</title>
    <desc>Buddy and Conker are joined by amazing Irish dancer and Kidz Bop British Sign Language interpreter Maisie! She needs Buddy?s help to make something tasty for her dancer friends to top them up after their energetic rehearsals. The only food that can jump as high as Maisie can are pancakes! So, Buddy makes bright green spinach pancakes stacked between layers of ham and an oozy cheese sauce - delicious and sure to knock the socks off her dancer friends! She can have it ready to go before dance class and simply pop it in the oven when she gets home. Maisie teaches Buddy to fingerspell his name in British Sign Language, and he tries to walk in Maisie?s very fast footsteps as he has a go at Irish dancing. Join Buddy, Conker and Maisie as they make a pancake stack that?s flippin? delicious and will be sure to put a spring in your step, too! You can get all of Buddy?s recipes, and loads more, at bbc.co.uk\/food.</desc>
