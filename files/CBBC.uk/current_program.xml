    <title>Danny and Mick</title>
    <desc>Pop sensation Zoe Now (Nadine Coyle) is coming to officially open Pottsfield leisure centre?s new reception. Joy tasks Danny and Mick with looking after the star guest but get in a tangle with the opening ribbon. Zoe Now arrives but Danny?s attempts at hospitality leave her without a voice - minutes before she?s due to sing. With the aid of a cap and wig from lost property, lots of smoke and a backing track, Danny reckons nobody will spot the difference if he takes her place. Mick plays Zoe?s hit song over the PA for Danny to mime to, but he gets too in the moment and accidentally skips the music tracks. After Danny initially busks it to save the day, they are found out. But Mick surprises the crowd with a fantastic acoustic rendition of the Zoe Now track which Zoe is very impressed with.</desc>
