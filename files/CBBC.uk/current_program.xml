    <title>Operation Ouch!</title>
    <desc>Identical twins Dr Chris and Dr Xand van Tulleken experiment and explore their way through the fascinating world of medicine and biology. Chris and Xand will let the viewer in to their exclusive world of medicine and explain the awesome things our bodies can do. The doctors demonstrate how our body movements are controlled by confusing their own brains. Dr Chris lets a blood-sucking leech feed on his arm and Dr Xand goes on call with an emergency ambulance team. Meanwhile, over in accident and emergency, a patient has locked their jaw wide open and another needs stitches after a particularly nasty fall.</desc>
