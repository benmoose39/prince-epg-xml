    <title>The Dengineers</title>
    <desc>Mark and Lauren get the help of experts to design dream dens for children. Dancing through life together, Jazz and Katelyn have been best friends since nursery school. They love all types of dancing and want to put a dance studio in Jazz's mum's cellar. Until now Jazz hasn't had her own space as her mum fosters children, so their house is constantly busy. The cellar is the only option. However it's full of rubbish and the walls are very damp - so turning this space into Jazz and Katelyn's dream den is a big job! Keith, Tracey and Neil can't offer much help either - they're the family's well-dressed dogs.</desc>
