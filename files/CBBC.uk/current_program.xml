    <title>Boy Girl Dog Cat Mouse Cheese</title>
    <desc>Mouse buys a video game that is supposed to teach the family teamwork. When they end up bickering as they play, Mouse creates a robot that turns off the game if they argue. However, a robot malfunction places the whole family in danger. To survive they will have to finish the video game without arguing - unless they can think of a way to make bickering help.</desc>
