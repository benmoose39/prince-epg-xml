    <title>Boy Girl Dog Cat Mouse Cheese</title>
    <desc>The kids get a chance to run Miss Skippy's new food kiosk in the park, where Mouse starts serving his own &quot;scientifically perfect&quot; chilli.

And if Mouse doesn't fix this mess then Skippy's will be bulldozed and gone forever.</desc>
