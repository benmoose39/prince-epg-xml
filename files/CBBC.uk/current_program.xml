    <desc>With Women?s Rugby World Cup fever riding high, one rising star has her eyes set on the top. Talented, fearless and utterly dedicated, 14-year-old Ava is used to pushing herself hard - but this summer, something unexpected shifts. Her coach asks her to help with a younger girls? team who are at risk of dropping out, and Ava starts to see how much rugby can give beyond winning. Along the way, she meets her Red Roses heroes, watches them play in the World Cup opener and pushes herself to the limit at her first England trials. What begins as a summer about chasing her own dream soon becomes a powerful journey of connection, confidence and discovery. As Ava helps inspire others to stay in the game, she realises what rugby truly gives you - and why lifting others can matter as much as any trophy.</desc>
