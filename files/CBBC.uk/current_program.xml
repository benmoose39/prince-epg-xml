    <title>So Awkward</title>
    <desc>It?s Humanitarian Week and the pupils have to commit to acts of charity and kindness in order to receive Community Spirit Awards. Ollie and Martha get competitive, signing up to teach digital to the over-sixties. But winning an award is going to be harder than Martha and Ollie think: Martha's pupil Mazel knows absolutely nothing about tech, and Ollie?s ex-punk student Jonny is anti-technology. At the charity sumo wrestling bake-off event, Lily threatens to shred her teddy bear to force Jas to admit she is the secret shopper. When Jas overhears Lily discuss the teddy-shredding trap with Rob, Jas ups the ante by threatening to shred her teddy, too. Only at the very last moment do they admit the truth to one another, saving both the teddies and the friendship.</desc>
