    <title>Dennis &amp; Gnasher Unleashed!</title>
    <desc>Dennis is blamed for a theft he didn't commit, and Mrs Creecher's new super-powered tech specs mean she can suddenly see way too well. She teams up with Sergeant Slipper to track down fugitive Dennis who has to somehow hide from the all-seeing tech specs so he can prove his innocence and find the real culprit.</desc>
