    <title>Danny and Mick</title>
    <desc>Naomi has asked for a raise, Joy?s advised her to take some time off to think about it, which is why Danny and Mick are in charge of the cafe. They?ve just about got the hang of it when a new automated smoothie maker arrives. The machine is supposed to make life easier, but that?s not how Danny and Mick see it. Soon smoothies are flying, and everyone is left with egg on their face. And strawberry. And a bit of banana?.</desc>
