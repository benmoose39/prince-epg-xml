    <title>Operation Ouch!</title>
    <desc>Identical twins Dr Chris and Dr Xand van Tulleken experiment and explore their way through the fascinating world of medicine and biology. Chris and Xand will let the viewer in to their exclusive world of medicine and explain the awesome things our bodies can do. The doctors experiment on their muscles to show how they work. Dr Chris meets some wriggly maggots that are helping to heal a sore foot, and Dr Xand goes on call with an emergency ambulance team. Meanwhile, over in accident and emergency, one patient has some grit in his head after a fall in the playground and another has injured his neck after performing a karate kick.</desc>
