    <title>Horrible Histories</title>
    <desc>A special episode about King Henry VIII, starring Rowan Atkinson. We meet the young Henry as he struggles with his boring dad Henry VII, before becoming king himself and going through wives like most people go through toothbrushes! Meanwhile, across the world, we meet the great Ottoman leader Suleiman the Magnificent in Turkey and the mad, bad and very dangerous-to-know Zhengde Emperor in China. With, of course, our host Rattus to guide the way.</desc>
