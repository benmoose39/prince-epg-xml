    <title>Horrible Histories</title>
    <desc>A special episode about the great French leader Napoleon Bonaparte, starring Jim Howick. We follow Napoleon as he rises from humble beginnings to be the emperor of France, bashing most of Europe along the way and ultimately meeting his Waterloo at, well, Waterloo! Meanwhile, across the world, we meet the Indian traveller who brought shampoo to the world. With, of course, our host Rattus to guide the way.</desc>
