    <title>Deadly 60</title>
    <desc>Deep in the waters of the Indian Ocean, Steve goes in search of the biggest fish in the sea, so big that it can weigh as much as a double decker bus. He also goes looking for the fastest fish on the planet, but travelling at speeds of 80 miles per hour, Steve's got his work cut out. After an encounter with a starfish that kills coral with lethal stomach juices, the crew's nerves are tested to their limit when a truly scary animal turns up uninvited at their digs back on dry land.</desc>
