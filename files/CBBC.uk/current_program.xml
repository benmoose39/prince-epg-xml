    <title>Bro's in Control</title>
    <desc>Can the bros survive Britain?s most haunted castle as they navigate spooky rooms, in an attempt to avoid the tricks and collect the treats? As if that wasn?t scary enough, they also have to face four terrifying Gladiators - Dynamite, Viper, Diamond and Apollo! Callum also invites Adam and Joe to apply for a place at his Witch School, but which witch will win the challenge and which bro will be forced to face an eight-legged fear as a forfeit.</desc>
