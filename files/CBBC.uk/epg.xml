    <title>Operation Ouch!</title>
    <desc>Identical twin doctors Dr Chris and Dr Xand van Tulleken show how incredible the human body is. With big stunts and exciting experiments, the doctors explore the extraordinary ways our bodies work and show how medicine can fix us when things go wrong. And in a new mind-bending strand, the medical twins test out psychological tricks on an unsuspecting public. Dr Chris and Dr Xand reveal the surprising secret behind the speed of your nerves, Dr Xand finds out what happens if you don't wash your hands, and the twins head out onto the street to test out a mind-bending trick that reveals how you can make your favourite cake look bigger than it is. Meanwhile, the ouch-mobile is opening its doors for more medical mysteries, and in accident and emergency one patient has a sweet stuck up their nose and another has an ear that is swelling fast.</desc>

However, with a sleepwalking Joy prowling the corridors it seems like everyone is going to get more than they bargained for in the morning.</desc>

He recently changed schools, moved miles away from all his friends and he hasn't complained once. That's because Kiran helps look after his mum, who has a disability which means she has trouble moving around. His mum's condition meant they needed to be nearer to family. In a place they are still getting used to, Kiran, and Pudding his dog, need somewhere they can escape, to let imaginations run wild and let their love of witchcraft and wizardry come to life.</desc>

    <desc>Kicking off the series in Buddy?s den, the gloves are on as Buddy and Conker are joined by Jackson, a young boxer who wants to learn a recipe that can pack a punch to keep his energy up! Buddy knows that Jackson loves a big-stacked sandwich, so what better than a homemade fish finger sandwich topped with crunchy lettuce and a simple two-ingredient delicious sauce, all packed into a soft bun?! Learning to cook means that you can make your meals exactly how you like them, so Jackson chooses to use cod and Buddy uses salmon, and things get messy when they breadcrumb the fish! Taking time out from the kitchen, Buddy is kept on his toes by Jackson as he gives him a lesson in boxing. Buddy learns to be light on his feet, throw a punch and read his opponent? Join Buddy, Conker and Jackson in this tasty episode of Cooking Buddies that certainly packs a punch! You can get all of Buddy?s recipes, and LOADS more, at bbc.co.uk\/food.</desc>

    <title>Danny and Mick</title>
    <desc>Pop sensation Zoe Now (Nadine Coyle) is coming to officially open Pottsfield leisure centre?s new reception. Joy tasks Danny and Mick with looking after the star guest but get in a tangle with the opening ribbon. Zoe Now arrives but Danny?s attempts at hospitality leave her without a voice - minutes before she?s due to sing. With the aid of a cap and wig from lost property, lots of smoke and a backing track, Danny reckons nobody will spot the difference if he takes her place. Mick plays Zoe?s hit song over the PA for Danny to mime to, but he gets too in the moment and accidentally skips the music tracks. After Danny initially busks it to save the day, they are found out. But Mick surprises the crowd with a fantastic acoustic rendition of the Zoe Now track which Zoe is very impressed with.</desc>

He?s made a series of funny, gungy and gross challenges for his Big Bro Adam and best mate Joe to see who?s the best and who loses, having to take on a forfeit from the Wheel of Doom. When a slime baby shows up at their front door, Adam and Joe suddenly take on daddy duties. But how do you comfort a slime baby, teach it to speak or take it for a walk without spilling the slime? And once that?s over, Callum challenges them to become life-sized toys and hunt around their house for epic accessories. Who?ll race back to their toy box first, Adam or Joe? These daddy-os are about to find out in this head-to-head epic battle to determine who?s the CEO and who?s taking a spin on the Wheel of Doom.</desc>

    <title>The Dengineers</title>
    <desc>Eleven-year-old Cammy is one of six siblings. You'd think that would be reason enough for him to deserve his own space, but Cammy also has Sensory Processing Disorder. Sometimes the bustle of his busy family home is too much for him, and when he gets agitated he knows it's too much for his siblings. He thinks they need a break from him as much as he needs a break from them. Cammy's SPD means he can be oversensitive to certain sounds, smells, textures and flavours. He needs a place where he can be on his own, in calm and quiet to let his senses relax.</desc>
