    <title>Danger Mouse</title>
    <desc>When Danger Mouse makes short work of Burt Badboy and his newly acquired band of fanatical feline followers, the group's leader Mandy and her cult of cats immediately trade in their colourful mohican hairstyles for eyepatches and become Danger Mouse worshippers. At first Danger Mouse is having too much fun to take notice of Penfold's warnings about his new-found cult status, but even he is forced to act when the cats follow his example a little too literally and live life a little too dangerously. Danger Mouse's attempt to disown the cats goes down like a lead balloon, and they use mouse-fu skills and a superpowered amulet stolen from Tutenkamoo to show their idol the error of his ways. Danger Mouse battles the frenzied feline onslaught and saves HQ from becoming a giant scratching post. However, this only reaffirms the idea that he is the chosen one in the minds of Mandy and the cult of cats. Danger Mouse realises that the only solution is to find a new obsession for the cats.</desc>

    <title>The Dengineers</title>
    <desc>Mark and Lauren get the help of experts to design dream dens for children. Dancing through life together, Jazz and Katelyn have been best friends since nursery school. They love all types of dancing and want to put a dance studio in Jazz's mum's cellar. Until now Jazz hasn't had her own space as her mum fosters children, so their house is constantly busy. The cellar is the only option. However it's full of rubbish and the walls are very damp - so turning this space into Jazz and Katelyn's dream den is a big job! Keith, Tracey and Neil can't offer much help either - they're the family's well-dressed dogs.</desc>

    <title>Danger Mouse</title>
    <desc>Danger Mouse and Penfold receive a crash course in the customs of America's oldest holiday when they cover for Jeopardy Mouse as she takes time off for Thanksgiving. After barely escaping from the war zone of a Black Friday sale, they find themselves back at Jeopardy's apartment. DM prepares to tuck into the plentiful Thanksgiving spread when Hissteria and Ham Hands rise out of the dishes. They announce their newly formed coalition and joint plans to vanquish America. DM sticks to his stand-in duties and refuses Jeopardy's help as he and Penfold follow Hissteria and Ham Hands' trail. They find the villainous pair hijacking the Thanksgiving Day parade - launching a gas attack from the air that will turn everything in sight to stuffing. With holiday-saving solutions at a premium, Penfold convinces a reluctant DM to call Jeopardy for help. Jeopardy assures DM that doing things with friends is what Thanksgiving is all about as they set about taking Ham Hands and Hissteria down. They distract them long enough to cut them loose along with the rest of the gas-filled balloons.</desc>

    <desc>Danger Mouse's over-reliance on gadgets prompts Colonel K to send his top agent on a tech-free nature retreat. Unbeknownst to Danger Mouse, Greenback has the same plans for his daughter, Delilah, whose social media obsession has also spiralled out of control. Back at HQ Penfold is tasked with protecting the entire world from the threat of super-villainy. Stripped off his gadgets, DM struggles to adapt to life in the wilderness and, when a talking pine cone called Conni begins to offer him survival tips, he begins to question his own sanity. Soon enough, Delilah catches wind of DM's presence and she plots to destroy him as a means of getting back into her Dad's good books.</desc>

    <desc>Danny and Mick?s dad Clive has turned up with his latest in a long line of ?sure-fire? money making schemes: washing customers? cars in the car park while they use the leisure centre. The boys are happy to help and are soon scrubbing away, but when Joy finds out and demands a free wash, the boys clean her beloved old banger so hard it falls to bits. Don?t worry lads, Clive knows how to fix this? or at least replace one problem with a much bigger problem. Yeah, thanks dad.</desc>

    <desc>Callum's pitting his Big Bro Adam against best mate Joe in this hilarious competition made up of funny, gross and gungy challenges. Who'll take the win and who will take a spin on the Wheel of Doom? It?s all up to Callum so they?ll need to impress him! When Joe and Adam open their front doors to find a 20m high crane outside, they know Little Bro Callum?s up to something! He?s challenged them to an epic Big Drop contest? with mum?s vase and their own phones. Which precious items will survive the drop, and how can watermelon and a gunge pool protect them? Once that?s sorted, it?s onto building gigantic hats with everyday objects in a bid to avoid Callum?s forfeit Wheel of Doom.</desc>

    <title>Deadly 60</title>
    <desc>It doesn't get deadlier than big game country - Steve is hot on the trail of Africa's big cats. He dons a camouflage suit to beat a leopard at its own game by hunting his crew, but it proves to be a lot harder than it looks. Nevertheless a once-in-a-lifetime experience gets him closer to a wild leopard than even he'd dare hope. After an eerie night sleeping out under the stars, Steve catches up with a pride of lions and witnesses them hunting right before his eyes, proving just how deadly lions are. Deadlier still when they start stalking him and his crew late at night.</desc>

This device threatens to turn the entire world into gold within hours. Quark's face print is the key to deactivating the bomb, and while dragging the extra-mouthed extraterrestrial across space wouldn't usually pose much of a problem to DM, Quark aims to see his plan through by exploiting his captor's recently diagnosed 'Compulsive Challenge Disorder'. With the HQ in sight and minutes to spare, DM's 'CCD' takes hold at the worst possible moment, and he abandons the mission in order to battle an army of bounty hunters. Can DM come to his senses and channel his affliction into saving his friends and stop the planet from turning into a huge gold bauble.</desc>
