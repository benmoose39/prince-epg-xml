    <desc>Joy is being particularly harsh on the boys - well, they did just spray ketchup on her best and only party dress - so to cheer Mick up, Danny puts on the freshly cleaned dress to do a silly impression of her. When the zip gets stuck and Danny is unable to get the dress off again, it seems like their day cannot get any worse. Which is when Mick gets his tie caught in the dress's zip while trying to unstick it.</desc>

    <desc>The OOglies slip, slide and splat all over the place. This fast-paced, madcap stop-motion animation uncovers the mischief everyday household objects get up to when no-one is looking. Superhero Slippy Nana sort of saves a peach from a terrifying ordeal, Count Grape-ula strikes an unsuspecting victim, the maki and iso ambush a suspicious nigiri in a ninja sushi attack, deep in the back of the mouldy fridge, Frankfurter's monster comes to life, and the conjoined cherries attempt to start a band in the talent show.</desc>

    <title>My Life</title>
    <desc>With Women?s Rugby World Cup fever riding high, one rising star has her eyes set on the top. Talented, fearless and utterly dedicated, 14-year-old Ava is used to pushing herself hard - but this summer, something unexpected shifts. Her coach asks her to help with a younger girls? team who are at risk of dropping out, and Ava starts to see how much rugby can give beyond winning. Along the way, she meets her Red Roses heroes, watches them play in the World Cup opener and pushes herself to the limit at her first England trials. What begins as a summer about chasing her own dream soon becomes a powerful journey of connection, confidence and discovery. As Ava helps inspire others to stay in the game, she realises what rugby truly gives you - and why lifting others can matter as much as any trophy.</desc>

Steve braves the big waves of the Durban coast to get up close and personal with a pack of 30 hungry blacktip sharks, getting a bit too close for comfort. After swimming in shark-infested waters, Steve abseils down to a nest of killer bees with a painful outcome. An eerily close encounter with a ragged tooth shark is followed by getting airborne with the awesome black eagle. Unlike Rourke the eagle, Steve comes down to earth with a bump.</desc>
