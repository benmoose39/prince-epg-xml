Meaghen has done her best to DIY a temporary glow-up, but it's time to dig deeper to undo and re-do a decade's worth of baggage. They enlist Kristen to work some money-saving magic to make over their whole main floor, including the plywood-clad front fa ade that makes the house look like it's been condemned. Kristen needs to make sure that the couple's wish list isn't too big for the budget.</div></div></div>
