    <title>Rachael Ray in Tuscany</title>
    <desc>Rachael is known for her delicious and flavorful pesto sauces of all varieties. She prepares a Pesto alla Trapanese, a Sicilian dish made with almonds and tomatoes; a green pesto typical of Southern Italy, which incorporates a few unique ingredients. Rachael's sister, Maria, shows how to bake a Basque cheesecake, a crustless dessert with a caramelized top. Meanwhile, John mixes a Gin Basil Smash, a cocktail inspired by a similar drink made at the Savoy Hotel in Florence.</desc>
