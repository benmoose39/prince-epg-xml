    <title>Million Dollar Zombie Flips</title>
    <desc>James Dainard decides to join up with a former flip partner to attack a zombie house in the form of a 1940s brick bungalow in need of a full gut job. The house shows real promise, but for James, the deal is overshadowed by the ghost flip, a flip gone bad from the past with Brian. Years ago, they teamed up on their first flip, which ended in disaster, and Brian hasn't flipped a house since. Now Brian views this new project as a chance at redemption, counting on James for the expertise.</desc>
