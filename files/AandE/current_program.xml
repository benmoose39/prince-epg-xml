    <title>Stadium Lockup</title>
    <desc>Protecting the stadium are highly trained men and women from law enforcement, private security teams and medics. In this episode, the security team escorts defiant smokers from the stadium while on high alert to ensure that the Kelce and Mahomes families go unbothered in their suites. The team also reviews CCTV footage of two incidents to see whether or not a woman flashed some patrons in one of the stadium's clubs and to determine who actually threw the first punch in a dispute.</desc>
