    <title>Beer Budget Reno</title>
    <desc>Kristen meets Kira and Lev, whose kitchen in their recently purchased home is in dire straits. Its chaotic layout and dysfunctional storage would be a frustration for any family, but Lev is a chef! The couple has invested the bulk of their budget into becoming homeowners, so Kristen has a big challenge to bring this chef's family a five-star kitchen on a two-star budget. Kristen also helps couple Marcella and Ramiro reclaim their open concept living and dining rooms from being overrun.</desc>
