    <title>The First 48 Presents Critical Minutes</title>
    <desc>Three cases from The First 48 that went cold, frustrating detectives. In Harris County, when a dancer is found murdered in her home, detectives wonder if the killer is someone she knew. Then, in Tulsa, when a young mother goes missing, her family fears they may never get answers, until a break in the case four years later. And, in Miami, when a homeless man is brutally killed, investigators worry a community's fear of gang retaliation will block their pursuit of justice.</desc>
