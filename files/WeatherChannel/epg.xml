    <desc>During Hurricane Harvey, realtor Crystal McDowell vanished en route to her ex-husband's home. Despite the storm's chaos, investigators pursued leads through floods and tragedy. Her car was found in a Motel 6 lot, likely abandoned by the killer. Days later, ex-husband Steve McDowell confessed to murdering her as Texas reeled from the disaster.</desc>

Police uncovered a web of secrets: a failed affair, financial stress, and a retracted restraining order against Dale.
