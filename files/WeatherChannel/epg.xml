    <title>Storm of Suspicion</title>
    <desc>On July 26, 2002, Ty Lathon was killed by a shotgun blast near the Shenandoah River. Tire tracks in the muddy scene led police to suspect Lewis Felts. Surveillance caught Felts cleaning his Jeep, and forensic geologists matched unique mud on his car to the crime scene. Phone records placed him nearby. Faced with the evidence, Felts pled guilty to murder and received 25 years.</desc>
