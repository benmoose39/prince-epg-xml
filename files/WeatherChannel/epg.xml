    <title>Storm of Suspicion</title>
    <desc>On January 13, 2009, 17-year-old Anna List was found dead in Michigan. Snowfall preserved crucial clues, including running shoeprints and a dusting of snow on her body. Investigators learned she had argued with her on-again, off-again boyfriend, Dominic Oyerinde. A search led to a claw hammer with Anna's blood on it, which Dominic used to kill her.</desc>

    <title>Storm of Suspicion</title>
    <desc>On November 26, 1998, 25-year-old Corey Parker was found brutally murdered in her Jacksonville Beach apartment. Despite overwhelming forensic evidence, no leads emerged until 2000, when Robert Denney, her 17-year-old neighbor, became a suspect. A DNA sample from saliva he spat into a puddle matched evidence from the crime scene.</desc>
