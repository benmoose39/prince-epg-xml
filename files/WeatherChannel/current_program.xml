    <title>Storm of Suspicion</title>
    <desc>On November 26, 1998, 25-year-old Corey Parker was found brutally murdered in her Jacksonville Beach apartment. Despite overwhelming forensic evidence, no leads emerged until 2000, when Robert Denney, her 17-year-old neighbor, became a suspect. A DNA sample from saliva he spat into a puddle matched evidence from the crime scene.</desc>
