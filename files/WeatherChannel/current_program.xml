    <title>Storm of Suspicion</title>
    <desc>In 1992, two masked men shot Ward Maracle during a robbery in snowy rural Canada. A quick-thinking detective preserved a shoeprint using molten sulfur, capturing a perfect Nike Air size 8 imprint. A tip led to Peter Benedict and Frank Lanoue-local criminals. Matched shoes sealed the case. Both were convicted, and Ward survived, with justice preserved by the cold.</desc>
