    <title>Katrina 20</title>
    <desc>It's been 20 years since Hurricane Katrina, and we're taking you on a tour of the trail of destruction in this hour-long special. From New Orleans' lower Ninth Ward to the Mississippi Gulf Coast, we'll feature stories on survivors who are still dealing with the impacts of this devastating storm. Jim Cantore will revisit the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Gulfport, MS, where he rode out the hurricane, enduring nearly 30 feet of storm surge.</desc>
