    <title>Weekend Recharge</title>
    <desc>Though it has &quot;weekend&quot; in the title, this show discusses the week ahead in addition to offering suggestions for what to do on Saturday and Sunday. Weather Channel meteorologists go beyond the elements outside and into the realm of lifestyle tips. Each host has a recurring segment on &quot;Weekend Recharge,&quot; which include helping parents get a fresh start to each day and explaining how the weather is expected to impact the weekend's scheduled sports action.</desc>
