The Beverly Hillbillies
This series follows the Clampett family from the Ozarks to posh Beverly Hills after they strike oil and become millionaires. Banker Mr. Drysdale tries to keep them from foolishly spending their newfound wealth, and he also tries to "civilize" them - usually succeeding in making a fool of himself in the process.
