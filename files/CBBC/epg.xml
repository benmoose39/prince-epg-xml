    <title>Deadly 60</title>
    <desc>Steve Backshall finds himself quite literally in deep water as he goes in search of underwater animals for his Deadly 60 list. The idyllic waters off the coast of Borneo hide a wealth of lethal predators, but just who is worthy of a place on the list? Camouflage, stealth and serious weaponry are the order of the day as Steve comes face to face with a highly venomous scorpion fish and witnesses the formidable spear mantis impaling its supper with its retractable spear-like arms. Just when Steve thinks he has seen it all, he finds himself surrounded by a gigantic shoal of barracuda in one of the most awesome animal encounters of the series.</desc>

    <desc>The action shifts to Steve's home turf as the Deadly 60 team scour the UK in search of its lethal beauties. From the wild seas off the Pembrokeshire coast to the New Forest, Steve proves that British wildlife is anything but boring. Gannets prove to be more than a match for Steve in a diving competition. He battles with the elements to reach the birds but the rough seas are determined to stop him. He then has to confront his past as he comes face to face with the only venomous snake that has hospitalised him. The Deadly team also have a close call as they uncover a hornets' nest in a loft, and Steve gets a taste of what it is like to be prey for a day as he is hunted through a forest by a hungry goshawk.</desc>

Buddy knows that Jackson loves a big-stacked sandwich, so what better than a homemade fish finger sandwich topped with crunchy lettuce and a simple two-ingredient delicious sauce, all packed into a soft bun?! Learning to cook means that you can make your meals exactly how you like them, so Jackson chooses to use cod and Buddy uses salmon, and things get messy when they breadcrumb the fish! Taking time out from the kitchen, Buddy is kept on his toes by Jackson as he gives him a lesson in boxing. Buddy learns to be light on his feet, throw a punch and read his opponent? Join Buddy, Conker and Jackson in this tasty episode of Cooking Buddies that certainly packs a punch! You can get all of Buddy?s recipes, and LOADS more, at bbc.co.uk\/food.</desc>

    <title>Danger Mouse</title>
    <desc>When Danger Mouse makes short work of Burt Badboy and his newly acquired band of fanatical feline followers, the group's leader Mandy and her cult of cats immediately trade in their colourful mohican hairstyles for eyepatches and become Danger Mouse worshippers. At first Danger Mouse is having too much fun to take notice of Penfold's warnings about his new-found cult status, but even he is forced to act when the cats follow his example a little too literally and live life a little too dangerously. Danger Mouse's attempt to disown the cats goes down like a lead balloon, and they use mouse-fu skills and a superpowered amulet stolen from Tutenkamoo to show their idol the error of his ways. Danger Mouse battles the frenzied feline onslaught and saves HQ from becoming a giant scratching post. However, this only reaffirms the idea that he is the chosen one in the minds of Mandy and the cult of cats. Danger Mouse realises that the only solution is to find a new obsession for the cats.</desc>

    <desc>Ubercorn, Glitch and the Go Jetters all head to the Dwarkadhish Temple in Dwarka, India, for the Holi Festival of Colour. This Hindu celebration involves people throwing a colourful powder called gulal all over one another. Glitch plans to bring a huge flag he and Ubercorn made as cadets for the top of the temple. But after he accidentally washes all the colour out of it, he orders his Grimbots to bring him gulal powder to dye it again. The Grimbots do this rather too well, however, and soon there is no more powder left for the festival! It's up to the Go Jetters to fix Glitch's mistake and save the celebration.</desc>

Seconds later, a knock at the door reveals a holographic Quark, who anoints Penfold as 'the chosen one' in a suspiciously automated message that culminates in an overawed Penfold receiving his very own magic wand. Penfold's joy is short-lived however - as he and DM step outside of HQ to find that the streets of are London teeming with hundreds of wannabe wizards, all brandishing identical wands. After discovering that the wands are mass-produced shavings from Merlin's legendary staff, the pair set out to stop Quark's latest money-making scheme by reuniting the staff with its rightful owner.</desc>
