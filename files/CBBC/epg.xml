Who'll take the win and who will take a spin on the Wheel of Doom? It?s all up to Callum so they?ll need to impress him! When Joe and Adam open their front doors to find a 20m high crane outside, they know Little Bro Callum?s up to something! He?s challenged them to an epic Big Drop contest? with mum?s vase and their own phones. Which precious items will survive the drop, and how can watermelon and a gunge pool protect them? Once that?s sorted, it?s onto building gigantic hats with everyday objects in a bid to avoid Callum?s forfeit Wheel of Doom.</desc>

    <title>Deadly 60</title>
    <desc>It doesn't get deadlier than big game country - Steve is hot on the trail of Africa's big cats. He dons a camouflage suit to beat a leopard at its own game by hunting his crew, but it proves to be a lot harder than it looks. Nevertheless a once-in-a-lifetime experience gets him closer to a wild leopard than even he'd dare hope. After an eerie night sleeping out under the stars, Steve catches up with a pride of lions and witnesses them hunting right before his eyes, proving just how deadly lions are. Deadlier still when they start stalking him and his crew late at night.</desc>

His Big Bro Adam is going up against best mate Joe to see who will win a series of funny, gungy and gross challenges, and who?ll take on a forfeit from the Wheel of Doom. Callum isn?t taking any nonsense, so they have to work hard to impress him! The National Art Gallery has called: they need replicas making ASAP! It?s a job for Big Bro and Big Joe... using flour and gunge, natch. But whose art will be fit for a gallery, and whose will fail? Little Bro Callum decides the winner in this epic art showdown. Not all is lost, as the loser gets a chance to redeem themselves in the No Hands Challenge. Who can set up a Date Night using only their pockets, their wits and a giant shark with a violin? Sound extra? Callum?s challenges definitely are in this hilarious, gross and gungy contest.</desc>

    <desc>There is a fire in the attic. Denis blames Harry, who has built a den up there out of Sapphire's discarded junk. Refusing to see the Burnywood fire and this one as a coincidence, Tracy and Gus break into the sealed attic to get forensic evidence. Just as they find some discarded cigarette butts, Gus falls through the burned floor onto Carmen's bed. Denis blames Tracy for Gus's fall and sacks her. Meanwhile, Lizanne has turned her attentions to Frank, who 'loans' her money.</desc>

He?s pitting his Big Bro Adam against best mate Joe to see who will win a series of funny, gungy and gross challenges and who will land an awful forfeit from the Wheel of Doom in this epic competition.

Little Bro Callum is challenging them to let him control their day. With tasks like bathing in cold mud, snacking on edible insects and wearing their pants on their head, nothing's normal in this high-key contest to be the best. After Callum?s decided on a winner, it?s onto the next funny challenge: will they choose to save their crab friend or their stuff? And why is a giant shark distracting them?</desc>

    <title>Wallace &amp; Gromit: A Matter of Loaf and Death</title>
    <desc>Wallace and Gromit have opened a new bakery - Top Bun - and business is booming, not least because a deadly Cereal Killer has murdered all the other bakers in town. Gromit is worried that they may be the next victims, but Wallace does not care, as he has fallen head over heels in love with Piella Bakewell, former star of the Bake-O-Lite bread commercials. So Gromit is left to run things on his own, when he would much rather be getting better acquainted with Piella's lovely pet poodle Fluffles. But then Gromit makes a shocking discovery which points to the killer's true identity. Can he save his master from becoming the next baker to be butchered? And does Fluffles know more than she is saying? It all adds up to a classic 'who-doughnut' mystery, as four-time Academy Award-winning director Nick Park creates a hilarious new masterpiece in the tradition of 'master of suspense' Alfred Hitchcock. Featuring the voices of Peter Sallis (Wallace) and Sally Lindsay (Piella Bakewell).</desc>

Meanwhile, Owen and Eli try to make it from the UK to the USA to visit Nero.

    <desc>Wildlife expert Steve Backshall meets one of the planet's ultimate killers, the saltwater crocodile, as the Deadly 60 team land in Australia's Northern Territories. A rogue croc is terrorising local fisherman, so it is time to lend the park rangers a hand in catching and relocating this prehistoric monster. Steve heads deep into an abandoned mine on a ghost hunt. He is on the search for ghost bats, awesome creatures with huge fangs, that drop on to their prey out of the night sky. Scary stuff, and a first for the Deadly team as these bats have never been filmed in the wild before.</desc>

    <title>Deadly 60</title>
    <desc>Naturalist Steve Backshall's quest to meet 60 of the deadliest animals on the planet takes him to India. He is on the trail of the saw-scaled viper, said to be the deadliest snake on earth and responsible for 50,000 human deaths each year. It might seem that putting it on the Deadly 60 list is a formality but, in a country famous for enormous snakes, Steve discovers that it has plenty of competition. The sloth bear seems an unlikely candidate for the Deadly 60 until it becomes clear that it has razor sharp claws and an incredibly powerful jaw, attributes that do not go unnoticed by Steve as he gets a little too close to one of them. Steve puts his martial arts skills to good use as he tries praying mantis kung fu in an attempt to get to grips with an insect with one of the fastest strikes around.</desc>

    <desc>Herbert has invented a new contraption to help him fly using an old set of bagpipes.

    <desc>When Blossom accidentally uses a witch?s broom to make sticks for toasting marshmallows, the owner of the broom casts a spell of squeaky voices on all the heroes.

    <desc>Hoofius has decided not to quest. Not because he would rather be doing a puzzle or playing his panpipes (though that is rather enjoyable), but because this will be his 1,000th quest and will be added to the Scroll of Honour for all to see for eternity. His friends reluctantly quest without him, but when they don?t return, Hoofius soon comes to regret staying behind.</desc>
