    <title>Pok?mon: Black and White</title>
    <desc>A vast Pok?mon habitat amid the hustle and bustle of the big city seems like the perfect new home for a group of five Genesect. The arrival of these mythical Pok?mon quickly becomes a problem, though, as their nest threatens the city?s power supply and they keep attacking anyone who approaches it. On top of that, they have attracted the attention of the legendary Pok?mon Mewtwo, who sympathizes with them because its own origins also involve human tampering. Their leader, a red Genesect, doesn?t trust Mewtwo, and their confrontation quickly rages out of control! Can Ash and his friends stop these two powerful Pok?mon before they destroy the city.</desc>

    <desc>Gladiator Dynamite is back to make sure things don?t get too explosive when Dr Dan and Dr Raph get into a Body Battle in a planktastic challenge to test their core muscles. On the basketball court, we meet Joel Henry, our Brilliant Bodies slam-dunk champion, to find out how he jumps so much higher than Dr Chris. It?s game on in the lab when Dr Xand becomes Saliva Man and Dr Chris tries everything he knows to overcome his superpowers as the doctors show us what spit is for. In an amazing Bodytricks, six kids surprise themselves by lifting Dr Ronx off a chair using only two fingers! And in the emergency department in Edinburgh, we follow the treatment of Niamh, who has broken her elbow doing a back handspring at gymnastics, and Adhya, who took a whack on the thumb during a hockey match. Ouch.</desc>
