    <desc>Nero heads to Hollywood to see if he can make his fame and fortune as a singer, dancer, rapper and all-round megastar. However, making it big in the Land of Opportunity is harder than he expected. He ends up living in a basement owned by the Tang Family, being represented by Hollywood?s worst most washed-up agent, and attending a college where he teaches a strand on British History ? a subject he knows nothing about. However, while Nero might not make it big he discovers a different kind of success with the friends and surrogate-family around him. Maybe this American adventure might just work out okay! Meanwhile, Owen and Eli try to make it from the UK to the USA to visit Nero. But a series of mishaps at the airport and on the plane mean their holiday doesn?t go entirely to plan? and they end up stranded in Alaska.</desc>

    <title>Deadly 60</title>
    <desc>Wildlife expert Steve Backshall meets one of the planet's ultimate killers, the saltwater crocodile, as the Deadly 60 team land in Australia's Northern Territories. A rogue croc is terrorising local fisherman, so it is time to lend the park rangers a hand in catching and relocating this prehistoric monster. Steve heads deep into an abandoned mine on a ghost hunt. He is on the search for ghost bats, awesome creatures with huge fangs, that drop on to their prey out of the night sky. Scary stuff, and a first for the Deadly team as these bats have never been filmed in the wild before.</desc>

    <title>Deadly 60</title>
    <desc>Naturalist Steve Backshall's quest to meet 60 of the deadliest animals on the planet takes him to India. He is on the trail of the saw-scaled viper, said to be the deadliest snake on earth and responsible for 50,000 human deaths each year. It might seem that putting it on the Deadly 60 list is a formality but, in a country famous for enormous snakes, Steve discovers that it has plenty of competition. The sloth bear seems an unlikely candidate for the Deadly 60 until it becomes clear that it has razor sharp claws and an incredibly powerful jaw, attributes that do not go unnoticed by Steve as he gets a little too close to one of them. Steve puts his martial arts skills to good use as he tries praying mantis kung fu in an attempt to get to grips with an insect with one of the fastest strikes around.</desc>

Not because he would rather be doing a puzzle or playing his panpipes (though that is rather enjoyable), but because this will be his 1,000th quest and will be added to the Scroll of Honour for all to see for eternity.
