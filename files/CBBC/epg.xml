    <title>The Dengineers</title>
    <desc>Helena is 11 and an only child. She loves star-gazing, wants to be an astrophysicist when she's older and is passionate about girls getting into science. She lives above her mum and dad's bookshop where they often work seven days a week, which means she doesn't get the chance to get out and look at the night sky! Helena needs a den to help her reach for the stars and fulfil her science dreams.</desc>

    <title>Operation Ouch!</title>
    <desc>In Ouchology, the doctors end up in a ball-throwing fight with their kid quizmasters, and it all ends with a snot, snot, snotting! Dr Xand rolls out the crushing machine in the lab to do an experiment to find out how strong your teeth are. It?s a packed Ouch and About, with George wanting to know why we burp, Clark asking why we need to sleep, and Ana asking why people have different eye colours. We fly across New South Wales, Australia, with Jesse and the Flying Doctors, to attend his hospital appointment in Sydney. In the emergency department, Nathan has an injured arm after jumping off the slide at Edinburgh Zoo and accidentally landed it, and Isabella is there after bending her finger backwards when catching the ball in Gaelic football practice.</desc>

    <title>Go Jetters</title>
    <desc>Inspired by the statue of the Giant Buddha of Leshan, Ubercorn teaches the Go Jetters all about mindfulness to help them to concentrate, be calm and be kind to each other. They go to visit the massive thousand-year-old statue in China, which is carved into the mountainside by a river. Meanwhile, Grandmaster Glitch wants to have a statue of himself, but the Grimbots have made it too small. He takes them to Leshan to the Giant Buddha statue to show them how big his statue should be! But when he builds a giant viewing platform on top of a boat, he loses control of the boat and causes a whirlpool, putting the statue, tourists and himself at risk.</desc>

    <title>Go Jetters</title>
    <desc>It's a whirlwind of windmill excitement as the Go Jetters travel to Kinderdijk in the Netherlands to celebrate National Mill Day. A lot of the Netherlands is below sea level and there is a high risk of flooding, so here at Kinderdijk, ditches and pumps are used to drain away the water. This used to be done by windmills using wind power, but nowadays the pumping stations are powered by diesel fuel or electricity, but the old windmills still work too! Whilst also flying over Kinderdijk, Grandmaster Glitch's Grim HQ runs out of fuel and crashes into the water. Furious, he sends the Grimbots off to find some fuel. They hook in to the Kinderdijk pumping station and start taking the fuel. Once they've taken all the diesel fuel for Grim HQ, the pump stops working and the water level rises, threatening to flood the area! The Go Jetters need to get the windmills going again to bring the water level back down.</desc>

    <desc>Grandmaster Glitch has been invited to Djenn? in Mali, Africa, to visit the people and to see one of his favourite things at work - mud! He is especially impressed by the spectacular Great Mosque of Djenn?, the largest structure made from mud in the world. But mud brings problems, and during the rainy season the rain causes damage to the walls of the mosque and the mud houses, so the local people get together to help repair them. Glitch wants to help, but when he realises they have to do this job every single year, he makes a massive umbrella to try to keep the mosque dry so that the local people don't have to repair it again. Although Glitch was only trying to help, things start to go wrong. The huge Grimbrella swings too close to the mosque and goes out of control. The Go Jetters need to fix that Glitch.</desc>
