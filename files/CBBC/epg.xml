    <title>Boy Girl Dog Cat Mouse Cheese</title>
    <desc>Mouse has built a rocket ship, and fame-seeker Cheese and excitable Dog decide they want to be the first ones to land on Mars. It would be way too dangerous to actually send these two into space, so Mouse stages a fake Mars landing with the help of the others. But when our two astronauts capture the 'aliens', everyone ends up stranded far, far away from home. Like, a 15 minute walk at least.</desc>
