    <title>Deadly Mission Shark</title>
    <desc>Steve Backshall has chosen his UK team of six to travel with him to Bimini in the Bahamas, where they learn how to scuba dive and become the next generation of shark saviours. The mission begins as soon as they land, and they have just two weeks to complete four training dives, but first it?s time to meet four local Bahamian children who are also joining Steve?s team. On board the dive boat, they encounter their first shark species ? the Caribbean reef shark ? a deadly predator engineered for hunting underwater. Then it?s off to the dive location to start the first series of tests. Some of the team take to diving with ease and soon pass the preliminary stage of their training. For others, it is a much harder challenge, with the tasks proving too much at their first attempt.</desc>
