Mr and Mrs Strawberry watch the sunset, until gooseberry ruins it. Fishing Finger dives in the kitchen sink and comes face to face with danger, and the manic mopping lemons are clumsily cleaning up. Daring, dainty meringue attempts diving with disastrous results, Dr Rhu-barb is chased by his arch-enemy trying to 'extermi-grate' him, and Fearless Pete Parsnip impresses the judges with his performing dog trick in the Ooglies talent show.</desc>

    <desc>It?s literally a packed show as the OZT HQ is crammed full of some of the fastest-swimming marine life and deepest divers surrounding Britain?s shores. Tyler takes the plunge in Plymouth to reveal how a special marine plant is being brought back from the edge of extinction to help fight climate change. Plucking up courage, he then dives deep to swim with sharks and is amazed by what he discovers about this incredible but sometimes misunderstood species. Just off Britain?s north east coast, Cam also slips into his wetsuit to go snorkelling with seal whisperer Ben. Getting up close with some inquisitive seals, he learns of the threats they face from plastic pollution. It?s all eyes on the Scottish skies as the OZT brothers go on a mission to the Isle of Mull to look for the ultimate soaring sea bird, the white-tailed eagle - but who will spot one first, and can Cam get the perfect picture? Back at OZT HQ, Aaron?s animal knowledge gets put to the test with some quickfire questions from the OZT crew, and Cam reaches for the sky with a drone to reveal how the incredible killer whale shots were filmed for Sir David Attenborough?s Wild Isles.</desc>

    <desc>It's farming time at the Go Jet Academy and the Go Jetters are growing corn in a big field. Their crops need watering and so the team are putting up an irrigation system which will water all the crops in the field. Growing corn is a slow process, and Grandmaster Glitch doesn't want to wait for the crops to grow. He shoots them with his size ray to make them bigger! The Go Jetters want the crops to go back to normal, so Glitch sets the size ray to shrink mode to make them small again. But disaster strikes when he accidently hits the Go Jetters and Ubercorn with the size ray and they shrink to the size of ants.</desc>

    <desc>When Colonel K disappears on a free holiday, Danger Mouse pulls rank and assumes the mantle of caretaker colonel. However, the role is much less exciting than he anticipated, as world-saving missions make way for endless paperwork. Meanwhile, K's freebie spa retreat happens to be a diversion tactic in Greenback's latest plot to take over the world, with the baron banking on the Danger Agency falling apart without its figurehead and the world descending into disarray.</desc>

Aaron and Cam go off-road in a bumpy dash across the wilds of Exmoor to try and gather more than 100 semi-wild ponies off the moor for their annual health check. Cam meets 12-year-old wildlife hero and butterfly champion Rebecca to find out why she is so fascinated with butterflies. Meanwhile, Tyler heads to the Forest of Dean to team up with ?the snake whisperer?, on a mission to track down an adder, one of our most secretive and threatened snakes. In the heart of mid Wales, Aaron meets a wildlife hero who has played a big part in the recent success story of the red kite, and he is blown away when hundreds of red kites fill the sky. Back at OZT HQ, Cam gets his hands on the latest wildlife filming kit to give us the low-down on how the incredible shots of high-jumping hares were filmed in Sir David Attenborough?s Wild Isles series. Aaron is put to the test with some quickfire questions from the OZT crew in Ask Aaron, and the OZT Gallery puts viewers? wonderful wildlife pictures in the frame.</desc>

The baby birds follow the grown-ups so they know where to go, and then they remember the way for the rest of their lives. The storks are flying high above the sea towards Morocco in northern Africa, but Grandmaster Glitch is also up in the air with his Grimbots working on their flying formation and nearly crashes into the migrating birds! In all the commotion the baby storks start following Glitch and not their grown-ups, meaning they might not make it to Africa.</desc>

    <title>Go Jetters</title>
    <desc>The Go Jetters are on Whistler Mountain in Canada, doing some skiing and checking out the amazing cable car. Kyan and Foz are about to have a go at the Go Jet Ski Challenge when Grandmaster Glitch comes along and wants to show them how it's done - but the sneaky Grandmaster cheats by using his jet pack to power him forward! But Glitch's jet pack is too powerful and propels him right into the cable car that Lars and Xuli are riding in. The Grimbots try to help by messing with the controls of the cable car in the control room, but they end up breaking everything and the cars stop moving. Glitch, Lars and Xuli are left hanging on to the cable car high above the ground and need urgent help.</desc>

    <title>Danger Mouse</title>
    <desc>Danger Mouse and Penfold accompany Professor Squawkencluck to the Brainiac Symposium - the annual science convention, where King Kong Brunels's latest misfiring invention, the Cow Trainer, reminds his fellow boffins exactly why he is the laughing stock of the scientist community. When King Kong Brunel suggests that the Professor's success is all due to her privileged life as Danger Agency lab technician with scientist parents, an irked Squawk uses Brunel's Cow Trainer to swap bodies with him in order to show that she could be just as successful in his shoes. However, she soon finds that life as King Kong Brunel is as dispiriting as he makes out, as she is laughed out of the symposium when masquerading as her simian adversary. Elsewhere, an opportunistic King Kong Brunel finds himself revelling at playing Squawk, as finds he himself inside her lab having hitched a lift back to HQ with an unwitting Danger Mouse and Penfold. On discovering the truth, Danger Mouse and Penfold have the body- swapper turned on them, as KKB escapes back to the convention with his newly acquired Squawk-shaped credibility, and a new invention so poorly put together that it could end the world.</desc>

    <title>One Zoo Three</title>
    <desc>Cam, Tyler and Aaron explore the wonders of the wetlands and meet the wildlife heroes working hard to help protect its animal inhabitants. It?s an early start for Tyler as he heads to Devon hoping to bump into a beaver and discover why this furry eco engineer is having a huge impact on the land and its wildlife. Cam is on the outskirts of Manchester to lend a hand restoring a wetland habitat that is helping combat climate change, all thanks to a super-plant called sphagnum moss. On the Isle of Mull, the OZT brothers go head-to-head as they look to spot an otter. They find out how this wetland wonder is making a big comeback - but whose animal tracking skills will win the day? Back at OZT HQ, a mini murmuration of starlings is flying around, and Aaron is ready with some starling statistics, but he has the crowd guessing when it comes to playing Fact or Fake. Cam reveals an incredible scene from Sir David Attenborough?s Wild Isles and gives Tyler a real soaking as he demonstrates how they might film similar shots using a super slo-mo camera. And the brothers find out what has been going wild near you, in the OZT Gallery.</desc>

    <desc>At the Go Jet Academy, the Go Jetters are about to watch one of nature's most spectacular events - a solar eclipse. They watch in amazement through their pinhole projectors as the moon moves between the Earth and the sun and its shadow throws them into darkness. As the moon moves past the sun, things become light again, but all of a sudden they are thrown into darkness once more. But this time it's not the moon passing in front of the sun, it's a giant moustache! Grandmaster Glitch has made a giant solar panel shaped like a moustache to power his Grimbots. To fix this giant glitch there's only one thing for it - the Go Jetters need to head into space.</desc>

Connie has dressed as a dog and made a huge, doggy maze game from cushions and suitcases for her dog, Jelly, to race through with Waffle. Waffle asks for one more race through the maze at home but Jess explains that the time for noisy play is over and offers him a quiet cuddle instead. After dinner, Evie tells Jess she?s been given her first reading book at school and gets the book out of her school bag to show her Mum. Waffle sits next to Evie and watches her read. When he starts to say words from the book out loud, Evie wonders if he?s reading, but Jess and Simon refuse to believe it.</desc>
