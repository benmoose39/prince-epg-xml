    <title>Go Jetters</title>
    <desc>The Go Jetters have travelled to Horsetail Fall in the Yosemite National Park. It's a 300m-high waterfall made of melted snow. Once a year the setting sun lights up the water, making it glow like fire for just a few special minutes. This is called Firefall, and if there isn't enough water from the melting snow, Firefall doesn't happen. Unfortunately, Grandmaster Glitch has built a snow princess at the top of the fall and is using an ice machine to stop her melting. When the Go Jetters arrive to watch Firefall, they see that there is no water falling down! Can the team save snowy Princess Glorinda and Firefall.</desc>
