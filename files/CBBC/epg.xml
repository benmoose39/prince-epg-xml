    <title>Go Jetters</title>
    <desc>The Go Jetters have been invited by the Korowai tribe to visit their village in the rainforest of Papua in Indonesia. They are an ancient tribe who build their homes above the ground, safe from floods and insects, using everything around them in the forest. Meanwhile, Grandmaster Glitch is also in the rainforest, trying to build the tallest treehouse in the world. When he sees that the Korowai's treehouse is even taller than his, he tries to get his even higher. But Glitch has built his treehouse from metal, not from things found in the forest, and his treehouse is not safe..</desc>

In the midst of an interstellar team-up, a bickering Danger Mouse and Jeopardy Mouse crash-land on a desolate planet. While Penfold, Squawkencluck and King Kong Brunel search for a way to bring the pair back to Earth, the stubborn pair split up in their new surroundings. DM and Jeopardy Mouse are brought back together when they're captured by a horde of Fly People - the planet isn't deserted after all! The Fly People's hatred of DM is explained when our hero is reunited with Lionel the huge World Wide Spider, who he accidentally sent to the planet of the flies. Lionel's fondness for snacking on the local population has landed him a place on the menu - he's going to be fed to the terrifying pit-dwelling 'Beast', and now DM and Jeopardy are going to be eaten too! Will DM and JM finally resolve to cooperate to get out of this perilous position.</desc>

    <desc>The heroes aren?t really meant to do quests without Mr Friendlyface?s express permission. But when they come across a cute little squirrel queen, and she begs for their help, they find her impossible to resist. All they have to do is quest to the Tree of Certain Doom and pass his challenges. But the squirrel queen is not who she appears to be, and the heroes have to quickly un-quest their quest.</desc>

    <desc>Herbert has invented a new contraption to help him fly using an old set of bagpipes. The 'Herbecopter', as Herbert likes to call it, is rather noisy but extremely effective, and Twinkle is unhappy at no longer being the only flying hero. So, when the heroes quest to get Friendlyface?s priceless locket back from a dragon, Twinkle and Herbert become extremely competitive and risk completely failing the quest.</desc>

    <desc>The Go Jetters have been invited by the Korowai tribe to visit their village in the rainforest of Papua in Indonesia. They are an ancient tribe who build their homes above the ground, safe from floods and insects, using everything around them in the forest. Meanwhile, Grandmaster Glitch is also in the rainforest, trying to build the tallest treehouse in the world. When he sees that the Korowai's treehouse is even taller than his, he tries to get his even higher. But Glitch has built his treehouse from metal, not from things found in the forest, and his treehouse is not safe..</desc>

The Chocolate Hills were created over thousands of years by water and wind eroding the rock, making a hilly landscape. Grass and ferns grow all over the hills and during the dry season they turn a chocolatey brown colour, making it look like the hills are covered in chocolate! The Go Jetters are also heading to the Chocolate Hills, but when they get there they are shocked to discover that the hills are covered in real chocolate. Glitch has turned the Chocolate Hills into a chocolate theme park.</desc>

    <desc>When Danger Mouse makes short work of Burt Badboy and his newly acquired band of fanatical feline followers, the group's leader Mandy and her cult of cats immediately trade in their colourful mohican hairstyles for eyepatches and become Danger Mouse worshippers. At first Danger Mouse is having too much fun to take notice of Penfold's warnings about his new-found cult status, but even he is forced to act when the cats follow his example a little too literally and live life a little too dangerously. Danger Mouse's attempt to disown the cats goes down like a lead balloon, and they use mouse-fu skills and a superpowered amulet stolen from Tutenkamoo to show their idol the error of his ways. Danger Mouse battles the frenzied feline onslaught and saves HQ from becoming a giant scratching post. However, this only reaffirms the idea that he is the chosen one in the minds of Mandy and the cult of cats. Danger Mouse realises that the only solution is to find a new obsession for the cats.</desc>

    <title>Super Happy Magic Forest</title>
    <desc>The forest has run out of bath sponges and is becoming very stinky. Their latest order never arrived, and so the heroes must quest under the sea to Merhaven to collect them. However, Hoofius, whose singing stinks worse than his armpits, decides to enter the annual Merhaven Song Contest and accidentally causes a simple quest to collect bath sponges to turn into something much more perilous.</desc>

DM prepares to tuck into the plentiful Thanksgiving spread when Hissteria and Ham Hands rise out of the dishes. They announce their newly formed coalition and joint plans to vanquish America. DM sticks to his stand-in duties and refuses Jeopardy's help as he and Penfold follow Hissteria and Ham Hands' trail. They find the villainous pair hijacking the Thanksgiving Day parade - launching a gas attack from the air that will turn everything in sight to stuffing. With holiday-saving solutions at a premium, Penfold convinces a reluctant DM to call Jeopardy for help. Jeopardy assures DM that doing things with friends is what Thanksgiving is all about as they set about taking Ham Hands and Hissteria down. They distract them long enough to cut them loose along with the rest of the gas-filled balloons.</desc>
