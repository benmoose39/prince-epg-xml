Unbeknownst to them a mysterious figure watches on from nearby, noting the clock's incredible time-controlling powers. When DM realises that the day is being stolen and replaced with a silent night, he enlists the help of expert colleagues - the night shift! With Danger Moth and Danger Mole in tow, the team track the quiet culprit. But a noisy Danger Mouse might just be outwitted by this stealthy saboteur.</div></div></div>
