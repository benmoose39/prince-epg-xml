Steve is wowed by a grass snake?s hunting technique, shows us how to work out whether an adder is male or female, and explains what to do to attract snakes to your green space! In a DIY demo, Steve gives us a privileged view of one of his most prized possessions ? a puff adder skeleton in all its glory! We see that this venomous viper can strike in the blink of an eye, and that corn snakes are awesome pets.</div></div></div>
