Steve heads into the blistering sun of the outback to fulfil a lifelong dream of finding the most venomous snake in the world, the fierce snake whose toxic strike could kill a quarter of a million mice in a single bite. Then the crew head to Tasmania where Steve finds a devilish mammal that will fly into a maniacal rage when competing for food. Also, he finally goes in search of a toxic terror living right in the heart of Sydney, diving into the harbour to hunt for the blue-ringed octopus - it might fit in the palm of your hand but one touch of this critter could mean game over.</div></div></div>
