Grandmaster Glitch also tries to join in the amazing maze action but ends up getting lost. In a fit of frustration, he glitches the maze by bulldozing through the hedges with his Grim-mower. The Grim-mower dives into the ground, causing the pathways to crack. Foz falls into one of the cracks and needs to be rescued.</div></div></div>
