Get ready for a sensory sensation! His quest sees him race in the dark like a troodon and track prey from miles away taking tips from the daspletosaurus, and finally he gets his hands on a real-life caiman to show how their pressure pits are just like that of the spinosaurus. Strap yourself in for a sensory overload.</div></div></div>
