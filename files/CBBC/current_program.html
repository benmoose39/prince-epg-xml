We look at how we?ve not always treated the planet's resources with the utmost care, from the 19th-century gold rush, to Henry VIII enjoying a little too much deforestation to build his warships In The Gone Show, we meet a range of animals that have recently become extinct, and we see how mankind has tried to work with and shape the land, from the earliest guides to farming to the fabulous Gardens of Versailles In Historical Educating, head teacher Mrs Thomas has trouble with her geography supply teachers (a Greek philosopher and a Viking), who seem intent on telling their pupils that the Earth is not round. We reveal that plastic bags were originally invented to save the planet, and in Time Beefs, Judge Rinder settles a dispute between environmentalist Rachel Carson and the businessmen who tried to stop her.</div></div></div>
