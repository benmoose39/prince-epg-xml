Cheese, Girl and Mouse all have great ideas for how to train Dog for the grand finale. And if Dog picks one of their finales, that sibling gets to be the trainer who shares in the prize! Boy also wants to help but gets shunned for having a less impressive idea on how to win. The contest arrives, but Dog is torn when it comes to his finale. Whose idea does he choose? Can Boy jump in with his 'unimpressive' idea and help save the day.</div></div></div>
