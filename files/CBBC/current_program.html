Squawk?s demonstration seems to go without a hitch - that is until the gang notice an exact duplicate of the HQ across the road, with identical duplicates of the Danger Team inside. When the duplicate Big Head is activated and starts causing mayhem the two DMs join forces to try and stop her.</div></div></div>
