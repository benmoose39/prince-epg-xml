Steve Backshall travels to Indonesia in search of three very different reptiles to add to his list of 60 deadly predators. He and his crew have a nerve-racking close encounter when they are chased by a group of ravenous, three-metre-long komodo dragons, the world's largest venomous lizards! Steve also demonstrates the incredible gliding technique of a tiny flying lizard and heads out on a nocturnal hunt for the beautiful but lethal green pit viper.</div></div></div>
