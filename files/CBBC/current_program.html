We follow Oliver as he rises from obscurity, challenges King Charles I in the English Civil War and ultimately orders the king's execution - as he says, it was a 'cruel necessity'. In other parts of Britain we meet a bunch of oddly named Puritan soldiers, and the great writers Shakespeare and Milton square up for a word battle. With, of course, our host Rattus to guide the way.</div></div></div>
