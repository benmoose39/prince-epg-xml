Meanwhile, the Go Jetters enjoy the cool sights of Harbin Ice City in China. Every year sculptors at the festival create realistic models of world-famous landmarks from blocks of ice, and Lars is attempting to carve the Eiffel Tower. Suddenly the sculptures around them begin to melt. The team investigates why everything is heating up and discovers a red hot Grim HQ sat in the middle of the festival. If they don't move it quickly, Harbin Ice City will melt.</div></div></div>
