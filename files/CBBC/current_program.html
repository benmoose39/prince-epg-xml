Alarmingly for Danger Mouse and Penfold, that guru turns out to be the galaxy?s biggest trickster ? Quark! DM is soon won over after seeing Quark demonstrate his Exaggerator Device: an invention that spins even the most mundane event into an outrageously overblown display of awesomeness. With the help of the Exaggerator, DM?s popularity skyrockets to dizzying heights, but fame comes at a price. And when Quark starts making Danger Mouse look villainous, DM will have to convince the world he?s not the criminal everyone thinks he is.</div></div></div>
