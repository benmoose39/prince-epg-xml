Dr Chris meets Nala the dog to see how she helps patients in hospital, and we meet two more of our ouch patients to find out what it's like to be a regular hospital patient. Meanwhile, in accident and emergency, one patient arrives by air ambulance and another is treated for a spring stuck in his thumb.</div></div></div>
