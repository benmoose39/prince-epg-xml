Determined to outshine Walter, Dennis will do anything to grow the biggest veg. Little does he know that JJ's gran's special potion, when mixed with Walter's dad's V-V plant food, will transform their plants into giant living, walking, groaning veggies. They turn to Paul the Potato to help them 'smoothie' out the situation.</div></div></div>
