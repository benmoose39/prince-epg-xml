Penfold has the deciding vote, so the pair are busy trying to convince Penfold to pick their choice. With Penfold busy inventing tasks so they can earn his favour, no one has noticed that a jam spillage in the professor?s experiment has brought a sticky surprise to life - a super-sized jam monster which might just ruin all of their plans.</div></div></div>
