It might be because today is Penfold's birthday and he hasn't remembered it again! Squawk sprays DM with her experimental empathy gas in the hope that he will find it easier to care about other people. The newly empathetic DM is a changed mouse! One who seems to think breaking the Baron out of prison is a great idea.</div></div></div>
