To survive, herbivores had to fight back! Steve Backshall goes on a mission to track down the deadliest of all dinosaur defenders. He meets the armoured tank that is Nodosaurus, tests whether an Iguanodon really has what it takes to beat a T-rex, and thanks to some mega-engineering, unleashes an Ankylosaurus tail-swinging robot that goes on the rampage and then some.</div></div></div>
