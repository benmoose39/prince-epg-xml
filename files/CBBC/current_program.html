He is taken out by the fastest feet on the planet when he goes up against a couple of cheetahs in a 'friendly' game of football, before heading out to see them in action in the wild. He also meets a monkey-snatching crowned eagle that uses its dagger-like rear talon to snatch up unsuspecting treetop primates. Steve turns the latest camera technology on a trio of Africa's deadliest snakes, giving a unique view of the venom-spitting cobra, the supersensitive boomslang and the split-second striking puff adder.</div></div></div>
