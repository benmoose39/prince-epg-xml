After a storm, Angela Bowling discovers a small helpless, abandoned bird which she lavishes with care and attention. She feeds Augustus (her little 'Loveykins') with the finest cakes and sweets. However, as he grows bigger and bigger, he longs for more bird-style treats such as worms and bugs.</div></div></div>
