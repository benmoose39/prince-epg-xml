To show this, Dr Xand uses the Ouchcam to give us an exclusive close-up of one of his freshly picked beauties, before he and Dr Chris use a supersized nose to make gloopy snot into something more crusty. We?ve got a Top 5 countdown of the Longest Longy Long Things Ever, including the mind-blowingly long, longest-ever burp. Gladiator Dynamite is back making sure Dr Dan and Dr Raph play by the rules as they go toe-to-toe in a body battle ? it?s all fun and games until the loser has to get into the ice bath! We get a chance to follow Dr Ronx through the whole of their hospital shift in Doctors on Duty. Emilia has cut her lip at school and goes to the emergency department in Liverpool, and Jake is in hospital in Edinburgh after injuring his neck when a pal picked him up and accidentally dropped him on his head.</div></div></div>
