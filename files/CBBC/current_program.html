They follow a team of scientists and explorers to Store Glacier in Greenland to explore the billions of tons of ice slowly making its way to the sea. Chris mounts an experiment with Andy Torbet to investigate the smallest inhabitants of the glacier - mosquitoes. Xand enjoys a spot of cake, and the scientists get a real surprise when they discover the temperature of the seawater beside the glacier. The whole team are gobsmacked when they witness one of the most awesome sights in nature - the birth of a gigantic mega-berg.</div></div></div>
