With big stunts and exciting experiments, the doctors explore the extraordinary ways our bodies work and show how medicine can fix us when things go wrong. And in a new mind-bending strand, the medical twins test out psychological tricks on an unsuspecting public. The doctors test a new theory to see if they can find out why skin goes wrinkly in the bath, Dr Chris meets a patient taking part in groundbreaking heart research, and test the power of your eyes in today's mind-bending trick. Meanwhile, there are more medical mysteries in Ouch & About, and over in accident and emergency one patient has a very sore head and another has dislocated her jaw.</div></div></div>
