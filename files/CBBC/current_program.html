Spending most of their lives in the canopy and rarely coming to ground means their populations are hugely threatened by deforestation, with their population decreasing by 90 per cent in just 30 years. Four years ago, Ashwika travelled to Assam and met a gibbon that touched her heart, and from that moment on she has wanted to protect them. On this mission she is going to a village where the people live peacefully alongside the gibbons and have done for many generations, and learns about why they care about them so much. Along the way she witnesses habitat loss with her own ?eye in the sky?. And she meets one of India?s top gibbon scientists, who is doing everything he can to save the species with the help of local villagers.</div></div></div>
