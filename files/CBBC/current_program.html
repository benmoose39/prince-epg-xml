Rare Amur leopard Xizi tackles a specially prepared assault course, while snow leopard Khumbhu is put through his paces as he begins training for a marathon move. Meanwhile, Jua the serval baffles the brothers with her aerial acrobatics in the high jump, and Yazi the puma sinks her teeth into a game of basketball. Cam puts his foot in it while cleaning out Aquarius the fishing cat?s stinky diving pool, and Tyler puts his super-sensitive sniff to the test as he tries to guess Whose Poo? And the boys look back on their African adventure, where they help a conservation project in Kenya track down lions and help protect them in the wild.</div></div></div>
