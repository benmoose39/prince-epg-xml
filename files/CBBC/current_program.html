There's only one thing for it - they need Prof von Screwtop to use his shrink ray to shrink them down to bite-size humans so they can travel on a sausage into Gnasher's tummy and find the slip! Easy! Well, it would be if it wasn't for the tiny alien empress Miasma living in there.</div></div></div>
