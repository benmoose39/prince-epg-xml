There aren?t many opportunities for people on the reservation, and life can be tough, but Laleeyah loves to learn about the traditions of her ancestors and takes pride in keeping them alive. Once a year there is the Pow Wow: a big, colourful, celebration where the whole Crow Creek tribe comes together to compete and celebrate with traditional dancing, music and dress. For several years running Laleeyah has been crowned Junior Miss Crow Creek - the best young dancer on the reservation. But since the last Pow Wow she has developed an illness called hyperthyroidism, which makes her feel weak and tired. As she comes to terms with her illness, Laleeyah still wants to hold on to the things she loves most: dancing, representing her tribe, and her crown. But will she have what it takes, and can she still be the dancing queen.</div></div></div>
