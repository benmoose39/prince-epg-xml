A-Troupe votes on which choreo they prefer, which leads to a stunning result. Uncovering a blossoming romance, Ozzy is asked by the couple to keep it secret, which Ozzy is more than happy to do as long as they?re willing to do whatever he asks. Meanwhile, Heath feels like an outsider, and Cleo encourages him to step out on his own.</div></div></div>
