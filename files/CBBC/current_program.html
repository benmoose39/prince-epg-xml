She?s always doing things for the family, so he wants to pop something in her lunch box to make her smile! Buddy knows the power of a tasty meal, so he teaches Jervis to make mini quiches that will fit easily in her packed lunch. They make the pastry from scratch, and because they?re homemade, choose whatever fillings Jervis and his mum would like best! Join them as they take time out from the kitchen to shoot some hoops and Buddy learns the essential skills of basketball; controlling the ball, dribbling, defending and shooting. SCOOOORE! Join Buddy, Conker and Jervis as they create super-tasty lunchtime bites in this slam dunk of an episode of Cooking Buddies. You can get all of Buddy?s recipes, and loads more, at bbc.co.uk\/food.</div></div></div>
