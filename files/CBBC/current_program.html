Steve enlists the help of an elephant to track down a very grumpy rhinoceros and stalks the forests in search of the largest cat on earth, the highly elusive and endangered Bengal tiger. He also has a chance encounter with a hive of honeybees in the centre of a busy Nepalese town before taking to the skies to paraglide with an Egyptian vulture above the foothills of the Himalayas.</div></div></div>
