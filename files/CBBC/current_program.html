As gliders do not have engines, Xuli is teaching two other pilot cadets how to glide using thermals to keep them up in the air. Not wanting to miss out on the aerial action, Grandmaster Glitch gatecrashes the flying lesson in his Grim Glider! Not only has his glider got an engine, but he also wants to make the lesson into a race. Not cool..</div></div></div>
