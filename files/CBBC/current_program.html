His mum is a professional salsa dancer, and Jaylen has learned all his moves from her, as he loves connecting with their Colombian roots through dancing. But there?s one thing that Jaylen loves even more... eggs! He asks Buddy to teach him an egg-cellent meal that he can make for his family. Buddy knows that if Jaylen loves dancing salsa, then he has to get him making salsa too, so he comes up with a cracking egg tortilla wrap filled with guacamole and zingy salsa. They learn to make their own tortilla dough in minutes, an omelette that sticks to the tortilla in the pan and colourful tomato salsa and creamy guacamole ? cracking! Jaylen?s keen to get Buddy learning his kind of salsa too, so Buddy learns the basics of posture and footwork with the help of Jaylen? and some colourful socks! Join Buddy, Conker and Jaylen in this episode of Cooking Buddies that gets salsa onto your plate and into your step. You can get all of Buddy?s recipes, and loads more, at bbc.co.uk\/food.</div></div></div>
