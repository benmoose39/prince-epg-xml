This fast-paced, madcap stop-motion animation uncovers the mischief everyday household objects get up to when no-one is looking. Mr and Mrs Strawberry watch the sunset, until gooseberry ruins it. Fishing Finger dives in the kitchen sink and comes face to face with danger, and the manic mopping lemons are clumsily cleaning up. Daring, dainty meringue attempts diving with disastrous results, Dr Rhu-barb is chased by his arch-enemy trying to 'extermi-grate' him, and Fearless Pete Parsnip impresses the judges with his performing dog trick in the Ooglies talent show.</div></div></div>
