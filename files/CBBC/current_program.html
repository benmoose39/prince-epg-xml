Steve descends deep into the Waitomo caves to find an unusual predator that lures insects to their death with a lethal lightshow, the glow-worm. Then he heads to South Island, to get an aerial view of one of the biggest animals on earth, the sperm whale, before driving inland to meet a very curious bird armed with deadly intelligence. The kea may be just a parrot, but its big brain makes it a hunter to be reckoned with. Finally, Steve returns to the ocean in search of sperm whales, and uses his kayak to get an awe-inspiring close view of this leviathan of the deep.</div></div></div>
