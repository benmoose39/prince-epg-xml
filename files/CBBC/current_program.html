Steve and the crew head into the beautiful Alaskan wilderness for another deadly adventure. It's the largest state in America, and is home to some of the most impressive predators on Earth. Out at sea, he uses radar technology to track down massive humpback whales, with a unique hunting strategy. Next he braves freezing coastal waters to get a close-up view of the world's furriest mammal. Adapted for the freezing waters, they do look cute, but don't be fooled - they're prolific killers and they have very sharp minds. Finally, it's back to dry land, where Steve and the crew go in search of incredible, imposing grizzly bears and witness these huge mammals in full-on deadly mode.</div></div></div>
