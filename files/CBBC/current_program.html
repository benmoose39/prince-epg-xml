The programme charts how Florence revolutionised medicine and the treatment of the sick during the Crimean War, but also how she also unwittingly sparked the public's desire for trinkets and tat featuring her image. Elsewhere, there's the bizarre practice of Victorian war tourism (tea, cake and carnage), a look at some Embarrassing Victorian Bodies, and a visit to Mary Seacole's British Hotel.</div></div></div>
