When Dr Chris and Dr Xand count down the Top 5 Bizarre-est Body Parts You Never Knew You Had, you will discover that the mysterious palmaris longus is so bizarre that you might not have it at all! The big question in Ouchology is whether it will be Dr Chris, Dr Xand or Dr Ronx who gets snotted by their kid quizmasters. If the doctors can put all the organs in the right place on their own bodies, they could win enough points to avoid the snot - but someone has to come last! Elsewhere, for Investigation Ouch!, Dr Chris finds out why real doctors are doing fake operations on fake organs inside fake patients in Nottingham. At the emergency department in Edinburgh, Alice has hurt her head and arm by accidentally running into a fence. And when Finlay arrives with burns on his forearms, the medics think it might have something to do with parsnips.</div></div></div>
