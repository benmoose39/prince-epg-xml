Things get even weirder when Sarah transforms into the wicked witch of the West Country, and Gav shows up with three little pigs. So when they all disappear in Bristol city centre, Ricky finds himself part of an epic art adventure. Ricky makes dragon feet trainers and a beastly collage inspired by artist Hannah Hoch.</div></div></div>
