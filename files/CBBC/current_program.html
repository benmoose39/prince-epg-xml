He explains how beetles find a mate, unravels the mystery of a trampoline tryst and reveals otters caught on camera by a clever viewer. We see a colourful escapee, a stick insect named Steve and a caterpillar colony that puts spiders to shame. In a DIY demo, Steve then shows us how to make a super-speedy bird bath to keep our feathered friends clean and fresh.</div></div></div>
