The Grimbots are on hand to recommend a shortcut: the Panama Canal, a man-made passage that provides a gateway between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Meanwhile, the Go Jetters are also heading to the Panama Canal to see its huge watery steps in action, but they arrive to find honking ships' horns and a huge traffic jam - it's all been glitched! In an attempt to jump the queue of ships, Glitch has jammed the canal doors open. Not only is the canal flooding and the other ships unable to get through, but Grim HQ and Grandmaster Glitch are sinking. With the Grimbots busy with their rubber ducks, it's down to the Go Jetters to save the day.</div></div></div>
