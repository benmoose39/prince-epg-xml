This fast-paced, madcap stop-motion animation uncovers the mischief everyday household objects get up to when no-one is looking. Superhero Slippy Nana sort of saves a peach from a terrifying ordeal, Count Grape-ula strikes an unsuspecting victim, the maki and iso ambush a suspicious nigiri in a ninja sushi attack, deep in the back of the mouldy fridge, Frankfurter's monster comes to life, and the conjoined cherries attempt to start a band in the talent show.</div></div></div>
