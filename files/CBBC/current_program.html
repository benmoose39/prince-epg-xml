We meet young Vicky as she becomes queen aged only 18, marries her true love Albert and has to put up with the open sewers at the not-so-luxurious Buckingham Palace. Meanwhile, across the world, we catch up with Australian outlaw Ned Kelly and discover plans for the Great Hedge of India. Yes, hedge! With, of course, our host Rattus to guide the way.</div></div></div>
