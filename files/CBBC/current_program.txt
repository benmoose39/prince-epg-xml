Operation Ouch!
Identical twin doctors Dr Chris and Dr Xand van Tulleken show how incredible the human body is. With big stunts and exciting experiments, the doctors explore the extraordinary ways our bodies work and show how medicine can fix us when things go wrong. And in a new mind-bending strand, the medical twins test out psychological tricks on an unsuspecting public. Dr Chris and Dr Xand reveal the surprising secret behind the speed of your nerves, Dr Xand finds out what happens if you don't wash your hands, and the twins head out onto the street to test out a mind-bending trick that reveals how you can make your favourite cake look bigger than it is. Meanwhile, the ouch-mobile is opening its doors for more medical mysteries, and in accident and emergency one patient has a sweet stuck up their nose and another has an ear that is swelling fast.
