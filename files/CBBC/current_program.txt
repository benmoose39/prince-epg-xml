Deadly 60
Steve and the crew head to Mexico's breathtaking Yucatan Peninsula. He embarks on a high-octane chase with the fastest fish in the sea, the sailfish, and witnesses these swimming speedsters obliterating a bait ball of sardines right in front of his eyes. He also dives on a pristine reef in search of a real-life sea monster and in a thrilling climax to his trip ventures alone, in complete darkness, into the 'cave of hanging serpents', where he marvels at the awesome hunting skills of the Mexican night snake, a cold-blooded predator that can catch a bat on the wing.
