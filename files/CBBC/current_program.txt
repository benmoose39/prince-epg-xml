Operation Ouch!
Dr Chris and Dr Xand show how incredible the human body is. The doctors crush a car to reveal the secret of the special fluid which enables your joints to withstand huge amounts of force, and they find out what it's like to be aeroplane cabin crew in Operation Takeover. There are two new patients to meet and First Aid returns - what should you do if someone has swallowed something poisonous? Meanwhile in accident and emergency, there's a gross alert as one patient comes in with a big gash on their head, and another has injured their foot.
