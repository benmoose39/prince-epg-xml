Go Jetters
Ubercorn is DJing a funky party at the Go Jet Academy for the Go Jetters and cadets to enjoy, when suddenly Grandmaster Glitch gatecrashes with his mighty electric guitar. Glitch starts playing rock music with his Grimbots backing him up on the drums. Although Kyan is loving the music, it is LOUD and starts to crack the Academy statues. Ubercorn shuts down Glitch's raucous rock performance leaving the Grandmaster determined to find a brand new crowd who'll love his loud music. He decides to travel to Chian in China so that the 1,000-strong Terracotta Army can be his adoring audience. But when he unleashes his rock guitar, the music is so loud it causes the fragile terracotta statues to jump around and the ancient army are at risk of breaking! The Go Jetters need click-ons to save the statues from smashing to the ground.
