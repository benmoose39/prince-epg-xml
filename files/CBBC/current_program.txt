Go Jetters
It's a very windy day at the Go Jet Academy as Jetpad comes in to land, zooming past the academy's windfarm turbines. Meanwhile, in a field nearby, Grandmaster Glitch is teaching his grimbots a lesson all about wind power by trying to fly a giant kite. But as the kite is launched, the strong wind catches it and pulls Glitch up, up and away - and straight towards a huge spinning turbine.
