Sol is determined to beat Leah in a game challenge with massively high stakes and a strict time limit ? both Sol and Leah bet their most treasured possessions on who will win. But then Sol?s dad keeps wandering into his bedroom and interrupting his progress. Sol thinks he knows the perfect solution and invites his grandad over as a distraction for his dad ? but the plan massively misfires, and grandad becomes just another distraction for Sol. Much to Sol?s dismay, the entire family go out to see a history of chairs exhibition? meaning Sol is running out of time to game. Luckily, Leah is slowed down too when her mother insists she?s not allowed to do any online gaming until she?s tidied her utter tip of a bedroom. Meanwhile, Mo, Cedric and Ray go on a mission to find a Wi-Fi dongle to take to Sol?s, but their simple journey turns into a series of misfortunes that see them getting utterly lost.
