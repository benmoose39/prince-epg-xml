Dennis & Gnasher Unleashed!
When the gang's sausages go missing, and they discover gnashed bicycle wheels and one of Gnasher's teeth, it seems like there's only one suspect. But Dennis refuses to believe that Gnasher is to blame. Gnasher realises he's being set up by Clawdia, Walter's ultra sneaky cat, and has to find a way to prove his innocence.
