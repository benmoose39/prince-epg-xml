One Zoo Three
Cam, Tyler and Aaron discover that it?s teamwork that makes the dream work when it comes to getting things done. Aaron calls on the help of the zoo?s keepers to see who can catch Cletus the dwarf crocodile moving in a game of musical statues. Green anaconda Optimus Prime's habitat needs a makeover, but with four hidden lizards to remove, it will need an eagle-eyed team to spot them.
