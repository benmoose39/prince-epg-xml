Danny and Mick
All the Pottsfield Leisure Centre staff are raising money for Comic Relief. Danny and Lance, as always, turn it into a competition to see which of them can raise the most money! But between Danny?s disastrously defective charity calendar, and Mick?s frankly frightening fancy dress, the brothers only succeed in driving the totaliser lower than when they started. It?s going to take everybody putting aside their rivalries and working together as a team to turn this situation around. That, and a lot of soggy sponges.
