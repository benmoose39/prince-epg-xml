Lagging
Sol thinks he?s been ?mugged? for his new game (a misunderstanding with some charity collectors, as it transpires). When Ray gets the game back Sol treats him like his hero. But as Ray starts overstaying his welcome and enjoying the payback for Sol?s gratitude, Sol starts wishing Ray would leave and let him play his new game. Elsewhere, Mo confronts the wrong ?muggers? when he tackles some innocent little kids and gets in trouble will Mall security ? and his mum! And Cedric enters a fancy-dress competition? not realising that it?s actually a competition for 6-year-olds.
