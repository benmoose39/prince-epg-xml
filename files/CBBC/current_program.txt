Deadly 60
Steve and his crew are back in the jungles of South America for this deadly adventure. Steve heads into crocodile-infested waters for a spooky nocturnal encounter with a truly shocking predator, the electric eel, and takes a boat ride up the Amazon river to meet another infamous water-dwelling killer - the black piranha, the largest of all piranha species. He also braves a thunderstorm to get a close-up view of one of the world's rarest canines, the maned wolf.
