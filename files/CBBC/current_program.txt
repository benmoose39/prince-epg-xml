One Zoo Three
Cam, Tyler and Aaron want to hold a superhero-themed party inspired by the secret superpowers of some of the zoo?s most incredible animals. Rica the armadillo comes out of her shell to show off her super-sensitive sniff, and Moby the eagle owl performs awesome aerobatics without making a sound. Meanwhile, Bactrian camels Mo and Navas display some serious suction with their super-slurping, and Cletus the dwarf crocodile arrives at the zoo ready to flex his pecs. Aaron reveals the mighty powers of the cockroach, and the brothers take a trip to Uganda to help a conservation project caring for orphaned chimpanzees.
