Horrible Histories
A special episode of the historical sketch show featuring all your favourite rotten rulers from the series. Including naughty Napoleon annoying his Josephine and horrid Henry VIII getting married again! There's also a song from wily Winston Churchill and, of course, our host Rattus to guide the way.
