Absolute Genius Super Tech with Dick & Dom
Dick and Dom put the eight finalists of the Absolute Tech Genius contest through their paces to crown one of them the ultimate absolute tech genius. Judging these finalists through a variety of challenges will be industry experts, including Jon Bentley from the Gadget Show, Clive Beale from Raspberry Pi, Lucy Hedges, the tech editor of the Metro, and our very own CBBC channel controller - Cheryl Taylor. The three finalists who make it through to the later stages of the contest will be flying out to America to attend CES in Las Vegas and Apple HQ in Silicon Valley to meet the ultimate tech genius - Sir Jonathan Ive.
