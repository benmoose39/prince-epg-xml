Go Jetters
Grandmaster Glitch demands the Grimbots find somewhere with no cars so he can practice riding his bike without stabilisers. He arrives in Venice and is delighted to find the 'streets' are empty. With a splash, he discovers there are no cars because there are no streets in this city of canals and demands the Grimbots build him some roads. The Go Jetters and other tourists now find their gondola rides blocked by roads and concrete.
