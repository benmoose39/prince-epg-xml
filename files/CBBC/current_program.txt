Danger Mouse
Danger Mouse and Penfold are celebrating another noisy victory, gleefully ringing Big Ben's bell, when an over-excited Penfold falls, pushing the clock hand forward, causing the sun to go down prematurely. Unbeknownst to them a mysterious figure watches on from nearby, noting the clock's incredible time-controlling powers. When DM realises that the day is being stolen and replaced with a silent night, he enlists the help of expert colleagues - the night shift! With Danger Moth and Danger Mole in tow, the team track the quiet culprit. But a noisy Danger Mouse might just be outwitted by this stealthy saboteur.
