Deadly 60
Steve Backshall and his long-suffering crew return for more deadly encounters with animals hoping to earn a place on his hallowed Deadly 60 list. Steve Backshall travels to Indonesia in search of three very different reptiles to add to his list of 60 deadly predators. He and his crew have a nerve-racking close encounter when they are chased by a group of ravenous, three-metre-long komodo dragons, the world's largest venomous lizards! Steve also demonstrates the incredible gliding technique of a tiny flying lizard and heads out on a nocturnal hunt for the beautiful but lethal green pit viper.
