Operation Ouch!
Identical twin doctors Dr Chris and Dr Xand van Tulleken show how incredible the human body is. With big stunts and exciting experiments, the doctors explore the extraordinary ways our bodies work and show how medicine can fix us when things go wrong. And in a new mind-bending strand, the medical twins test out psychological tricks on an unsuspecting public. With the help of opera singer Lucy O'Byrne, the doctors reveal the hidden muscle that makes you breathe. Dr Xand heads to a DNA laboratory to solve the mystery of who stole his strawberry milk and there is a chance to play along at home with another mind-bending trick. Meanwhile, the ouch-mobile is open for business, and over in accident and emergency one patient has cut their eyebrow and another has stapled his own finger.
