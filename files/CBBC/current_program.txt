Go Jetters
In Japan, Grandmaster Glitch is at a railway station, wondering where his grimbots have gone. Some excited bleeps further down the platform reveal that they have jumped into the driver's cabin of a bullet train and are happily pressing all the buttons! Glitch shouts at them to stop but it is too late: he quickly jumps onboard as the doors slam shut and the train moves off - leaving the station without its driver. Meanwhile, at the next station, the Go Jetters are excitedly waiting with their tickets to ride the bullet train. The train approaches but doesn't stop, racing past the Go Jetters as Grandmaster Glitch shouts out of the window. The Go Jetters realise the train has been glitched.
