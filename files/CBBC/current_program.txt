Danny and Mick
The centre needs to be decorated for a wedding later today, but Danny?s more interested in his new invention ? which unfortunately blows through every toilet roll in the centre. When Mick distracts him mid-order, he accidentally requests 10,000 toilet rolls instead of 100 by express delivery, and they arrive in a whole mountain of boxes. Fearing Joy?s reaction, the boys decide to hide the loo rolls.
