Danny and Mick
It?s the annual five-a-side challenge match against the rival leisure centre, and team captain Lance knows exactly what position to play Danny and Mick in: the laundry room, well away from anywhere they can do anything that will cost them the game. However, a tiny accident with the kit leads to a mass walk-out from the team, and it?s up to Danny, Mick, and three other dummies to take to the field for the beautiful game and become leisure centre legends.
