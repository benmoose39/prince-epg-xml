Horrible Histories
A look at some of history's greatest artists, from the first images painted onto the walls of caves through to Chris Ofili's work with elephant poo. We discover the most stolen painting in history, how Picasso and Dali found innovative ways of paying for things without using money and the horror of painting people smiling, and we see the Teenage Mutant Ninja Renaissance Artists help a lady in distress. Sort of.
