Go Jetters
When Grandmaster Glitch discovers his Halloween pumpkin isn't as big as the Grimbots' one, he goes in search of some fertilizer to help it grow. Meanwhile, Xuli is testing her new sonar-equipped GO Dive at the Gua Rusa cave in Borneo. Gua Rusa is so big, a jumbo jet could fly through it. It's home to millions of bats, and Glitch is after all the bat droppings to use as pumpkin fertiliser.
