Horrible Histories
A special episode of the historical sketch show, featuring all your favourite songs from the series! Sing along with King Alfred about his burnt cakes, or with Henry VIII about his love of reformation - or get down Norman-style with William the Conqueror. With, of course, our host Rattus to guide the way.
