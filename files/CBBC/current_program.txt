Planet Defenders
Jahawi is an underwater camera operator who is passionate about preserving the coastline of Kenya, his home country. The ocean is home to a whole host of marine wildlife, but one species here is particularly under threat: dolphins. This fun and curious mammal is facing a number of issues, as their habitat is being destroyed and the fish they eat are being depleted. There is also significant human activity on this coastline, which is damaging the marine life. However, Lamu has stood the test of time and is a marine sanctuary for them, with a new port being built and things about to change. Working with the Kenyan Marine Mammal Network, Jahawi is hoping to get the area protected as a marine reserve before it?s too late. It doesn?t take long for Jahawi to find the resident bottle-nosed dolphins as they enjoy swimming at the bow of the boat, and he soon gets into the water with the dolphins to get a closer look at these magnificent creatures. One species of dolphin he is hoping to find and film is the rare humpback dolphin.
