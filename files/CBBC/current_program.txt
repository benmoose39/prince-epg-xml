Operation Ouch!
Could farts power a rocket? If you ask a question like that to Dr Chris and Dr Xand, you know they will want to investigate ? and if they can, they will blast off an actual rocket too! We welcome Gladiator Dynamite to Team Ouch! Her job is to referee Dr Dan and Dr Raph as they pit their bodies against each other in Dan vs Raph: Body Battles. Today, it?s a muscle they are testing: the triceps. Will it be Dr Dan or Dr Raph who ends up in the ice bath as a loser?s forfeit? One thing is for sure, Dynamite?s decision is final! Doctors Chris, Xand and Ronx are Ouch and About giving answers to kids? medical questions, with Margot asking why people have asthma. In Australia, the Flying Doctors fly Jack and his mum to hospital in New South Wales for a check-up following Jack's bone marrow transplant. Back in the emergency department in the UK, Logan has hurt his knee after tripping and landing on a log, and Harshali has a pink bead stuck up her nose! Ouch.
