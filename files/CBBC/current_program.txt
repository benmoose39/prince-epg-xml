Planet Defenders
Erin Ranney is a wildlife camera operator and adventurer. She splits her time between Alaska and the Falklands, and loves filming the planet?s most incredible wildlife. Erin?s mission is to film rockhopper penguins on the Falkland Islands and find out why these charismatic creatures are facing serious threats to their survival. She investigates why the rockhopper population has fallen by 80 per cent since the 1930s. Climate change is the biggest threat to the rockhoppers, causing violent storms that could see them face extinction. Erin also finds out how planting tussac grass can combat climate change and discovers that what we do in our own countries can affect these penguins thousands of miles away. She talks about how we can all make a difference towards helping the planet, just by taking small steps.
