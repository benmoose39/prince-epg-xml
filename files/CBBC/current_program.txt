Danger Mouse
The danger agents are at Squawk's super-secret Wild West testing facility, home to a society of Penbots, robots who have a rather familiar face. Squawk is sure she has improved upon Penfold and made the perfect robotic sidekick for Danger Mouse, Tenfold. But Tenfold malfunctions and transforms into the ruthless Meanfold, determined to destroy anyone who is not quite perfect.
