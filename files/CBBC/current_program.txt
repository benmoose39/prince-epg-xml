Operation Ouch!
Dr Xand?s favourite cold virus is the rhinovirus: that?s one that gets right up your nose and gives you the sniffles. So when the doctors get a question in the lab asking why your nose runs when you have a cold, they decide to become rhinoviruses and attack the body?s defences through a giant nose. We also get a chance to see right inside Dr Xand?s nostrils when he sticks a camera up his nose to show Dr Chris a real-life, flapping bogey specimen - gross alert! Dr Ronx makes a whole class of schoolchildren forget where their elbows are with a mind-blowing body trick you can try on your friends, and in Ouch and About, Ethan wants to know which is the strongest bone in his body. Over in Australia, six-year-old Jakobi is flown by helicopter to Sydney by the Flying Doctors because his local hospital thinks he needs specialist care. Lucy goes to the hospital in Edinburgh to find out why she?s woken up with a swollen face. And in Liverpool, Michael?s foot has been run over by a car, so no surprise that he?s ended up in the emergency department. Ouch.
