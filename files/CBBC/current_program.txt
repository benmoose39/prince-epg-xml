Boy Girl Dog Cat Mouse Cheese
Everybody gets jealous when Boy bakes amazing cookies that he only shares with his new pen pal, Gretchen. They band together and pretend to be Gretchen, writing letters to Boy and asking him to send more cookies, which they then intercept and eat for themselves. However, when Boy asks to meet Gretchen in person, Girl, Dog, Cat, Mouse and Cheese come up with a plan to impersonate her and steal Boy's cookie recipe once and for all.
