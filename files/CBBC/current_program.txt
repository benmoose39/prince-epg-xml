Operation Ouch!
Identical twin doctors Dr Chris and Dr Xand van Tulleken show how incredible the human body is. With big stunts and exciting experiments, the doctors explore the extraordinary ways our bodies work and show how medicine can fix us when things go wrong. And in a new mind-bending strand, the medical twins test out psychological tricks on an unsuspecting public. In this episode, the doctors reveal where your blood comes from, Dr Chris meets a patient undergoing life-changing brain surgery and there is a mind-bending trick to test the powers of concentration. There are also more medical mysteries in Ouch and About, and in accident and emergency one patient is in with a double sporting injury, while another has taken a nasty tumble with her horse.
