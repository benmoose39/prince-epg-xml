Deadly Dinosaurs with Steve Backshall
In this episode of Deadly Dinosaurs, Steve's getting freaky! He's on a mission to find the weirdest dinosaur ever! He kick-starts with gigantoraptor, an eight-metre-tall giant that laid the biggest eggs in history. The, courtesy of a monster truck crash, he meets the miniscule magyarosaurus. But that's not freaky enough, so finally he focuses on a dinosaur that head-butted its rivals to death - something Steve's hoping to replicate with the mother of all robots! Weird.
