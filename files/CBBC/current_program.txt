Deadly Dinosaurs with Steve Backshall
In this episode of Deadly Dinosaurs, Steve discovers just what it takes to be a terror from the skies, and believe us, it's a wild ride! He starts by strapping himself into one of Britain's fastest wind tunnels where he goes head to head against the Microraptor. Then he goes green - literally - as he hitches a ride in a stunt plane. Finally, he unleashes the big guns as he takes on the biggest flying animal in history - Hatzegoptyrex - where Steve meets another epic blast from the past.
