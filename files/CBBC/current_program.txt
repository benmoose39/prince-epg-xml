Operation Ouch!
Identical twin doctors Dr Chris and Dr Xand van Tulleken show how incredible the human body is. With big stunts and exciting experiments, the doctors explore the extraordinary ways our bodies work and show how medicine can fix us when things go wrong. And in a new mind-bending strand, the medical twins test out psychological tricks on an unsuspecting public. The doctors test a new theory to see if they can find out why skin goes wrinkly in the bath, Dr Chris meets a patient taking part in groundbreaking heart research, and test the power of your eyes in today's mind-bending trick. Meanwhile, there are more medical mysteries in Ouch & About, and over in accident and emergency one patient has a very sore head and another has dislocated her jaw.
