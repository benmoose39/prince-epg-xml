Go Jetters
Grandmaster Glitch tries his hand at stunt flying, but the Grimbots are unimpressed, giving him a unanimous thumbs down. He tries again, but it's one loop-the-loop too much for poor old Grim HQ and it crash-lands in the branches of a baobab tree. Lars makes friends with a baby lemur whose family has been scared away by a bright light and loud banging in the distance. The team investigates and discovers the cause: Grandmaster Glitch is illuminating Grim HQ with floodlights, while his Grimbots try to dislodge it from the tree.
