My Life
Miyawata is a 15-year-old indigenous activist from Winnipeg, Canada, who never hesitates?to?speak up for what she believes in.?Each morning,?schools?in Canada play?the national anthem, and all students are expected to stand. In protest of?the injustices that her people have faced throughout the history of Canada,?Miyawata sits down instead.?But will she be able to persuade the head teacher to change the school?s land rights acknowledgement? Miyawata is also?the organiser?of school climate strikes in her hometown. The climate movement in Winnipeg had enormous momentum until Covid hit, and now that the end of the pandemic is in sight, she wants to get the movement going again.
