Deadly Dinosaurs with Steve Backshall
If you thought that dinosaurs were the most dangerous things in the Jurassic, think again! There was actually something way worse and far more deadly! In this episode, Steve goes on a mission to uncover what was deadlier than the dinosaurs - from massive monsoons and supersized sandstorms to ballistic bacteria and gory gas. And in an epic finale, Steve ends with a bang as he recreates the dinosaur-killing asteroid impact in an experiment that's second to none.
