Boy Girl Dog Cat Mouse Cheese
The kids are spending a fun day with Gramps, but Boy and Girl are so absorbed in a new game they are playing that they don?t get into the swing of the activities he has planned. They try to put it right when they realise that this has hurt Gramps?s feelings, but end up putting all the kids in danger.
