Operation Ouch!
The doctors reveal how amazing your saliva is, and they find out why the hospital's maintenance team work with birds of prey in Operation Takeover. Dr Chris heads to the Emergency Department to find how the doctors know who to treat first, and we catch up with Ouch patients Ruby and Tola. Meanwhile in accident and emergency one patient arrives by air ambulance after a rugby match and another has a cut on her foot after it was caught in a bike wheel.
