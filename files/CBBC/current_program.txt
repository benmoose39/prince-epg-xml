Deadly 60
Steve Backshall and the crew head for the island paradise of Sri Lanka in search of two massive predators. Steve attempts to free dive with the largest animal ever known to have lived - the blue whale. Back on dry land, he goes in search of another giant, the Asian elephant. Along the way, Steve and the crew also encounter two very deadly snakes, a highly venomous Russell's viper and an enormous, bone-crushing Indian rock python.
