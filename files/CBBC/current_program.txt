Danger Mouse
Colonel K spins a terrifying tale about the Headless Postman - an ancient and alarmingly scary apparition. When the haunting figure of the postman suddenly appears, petrified panic reigns supreme amongst the Danger Agents, until Squawkencluck reveals herself as the postman in disguise and that the whole scenario has been a company-mandated bravery test. By remaining characteristically unfazed throughout, Danger Mouse fails the exam, which puts his job at risk, as in Squawk's words 'being truly brave means being afraid of something and still taking it on'. The gang try to scare DM, but he's fearless... until he discovers that the Headless Postman lives.
