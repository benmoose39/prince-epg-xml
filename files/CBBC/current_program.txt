Deadly 60
Steve and the crew return to Mexico in search of more animals to add to the Deadly 60. Steve searches a swamp at night for a rare and beautiful crocodile with a nasty bite, before heading to the stunning Mexican coastline for an exhilarating encounter with one of the most dangerous sharks in the world, the bull shark. Finally he witnesses the awesome spectacle and hunting power of one of the greatest gathering of predators on Earth, as a million-strong bat army take to the night sky.
