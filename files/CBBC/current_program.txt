Deadly Mission Shark
Steve Backshall and his team of young shark saviours are coming to the end of their time in the shark sanctuary around the island of Bimini in the Bahamas. All ten of them have completed four separate open water dives, passing forty different skills. Now, they are on their last dive ? to see great hammerheads. First, the team must find this great shark, but things don?t initially go according to plan. There is a restless wait on board the dive boat until Steve dives and then calls the team in to join him. Finally, they see a very special great hammerhead ? one that Steve has met before. The experience convinces them all to carry on championing sharks of all species, long after they leave the island.
