Danger Mouse
It's Christmas! DM and Penfold are tasked with protecting Santa from the villainous clutches of the festive season-destroying Snowman. Embarrassingly inept villain the Snowman is fed-up with being humiliatingly defeated by Danger Mouse and decides to get revenge by kidnapping Father Christmas. This time, DM and Penfold's attempts to thwart the Snowman end in disaster, with the villain superpowered by Christmas spirit and Santa's hat! In a whirlwind of bah and humbug, the Snowman sabotages the festive holiday and threatens to destroy the world by freezing the sun. DM must lead an army of elves and a rejuvenated Santa to battle the Snowman and melt his evil plans.
