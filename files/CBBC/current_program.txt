Deadly 60
Steve and the crew are back in Australia for one of Steve's most dramatic encounters ever as he dangles beneath a helicopter and is dropped into the nest of giant, wild saltwater crocodiles. He also goes in search of the most venomous animal on earth, the box jellyfish - one sting could be fatal, so caution is an absolute must. Finally, he enters a snake-infested marshland on a hunt for two lethal contenders for his list - the tiger snake and the copperhead snake.
