Go Jetters
Grandmaster Glitch is out on a camping expedition in Mongolia. There's not much around except a group of Mongolian nomads - people who travel around the country with their animals, camping in amazing tents called gers. Glitch visits their camp and inadvertently offends them, then his misfiring jetpack causes him to land on one of their precious horses, causing it to gallop away from the camp with Glitch on its back! The Go Jetters take to the Vroomster to try and stop Glitch and the runaway horse but end up scaring the horses and causing a stampede. They need click-ons to calm down the Mongolian horses before things get out of control.
