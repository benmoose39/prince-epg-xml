Danger Mouse
After reports of unexplained unruliness at the UN, Danger Mouse and Penfold arrive to scenes of quarrelling diplomats, whose messages of peace and goodwill have been turned into playground insults by the sabotaged translation system. Danger Mouse spots the culprit, Crumhorn, lurking in the shadows and goes after him but is stopped in his tracks by Ian, for whom the UN's security is apparently no match.
