Deadly Dinosaurs with Steve Backshall
The Jurassic was home to the most vicious and violent predators the world has ever seen. To survive, herbivores had to fight back! Steve Backshall goes on a mission to track down the deadliest of all dinosaur defenders. He meets the armoured tank that is Nodosaurus, tests whether an Iguanodon really has what it takes to beat a T-rex, and thanks to some mega-engineering, unleashes an Ankylosaurus tail-swinging robot that goes on the rampage and then some.
