Deadly 60
Steve returns to South America to search for more of the planet's deadliest animals. He joins a team trying to save a highly endangered predator, the orinoco crocodile, and witnesses the ferocious maternal instincts of a female crocodile protecting her nest. In Brazil, he heads out for a night-time encounter with a metre-long monster of the Amazonian waterways, the wolf fish, and back on dry land, Steve turns to technology in an attempt to track down one of South America's most elusive jungle predators, the enigmatic jaguar.
