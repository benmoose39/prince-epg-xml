Deadly 60
Steve Backshall's search for deadly animals takes him and the crew to South Africa. This time they're looking for one of the most iconic of them all, the ferocious great white shark. He gets some fantastic views of this king of the ocean, and to demonstrate their awesome hunting prowess, he has a special trick up his sleeve. Just as feared by many is the Cape buffalo, known locally as the black death. Steve takes to the skies to track down a huge herd of this notoriously bad-tempered bovine beast before being charmed by the snake-stomping secretary bird.
