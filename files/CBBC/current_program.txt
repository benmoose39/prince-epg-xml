Cooking Buddies
Buddy and Conker are joined in their cooking den by Alex, a figure skater who wants a meal that will warm him and his friend up after training on the ice! Alex likes meat, but his friend is vegetarian, so he needs Buddy?s help with something that will keep them both happy... Buddy knows that burgers are a winner as they?re super-flexible, so he creates the ultimate burger for Alex that?s half beef mince and half lentils that his friend can swap for veggie mince and lentils. Using lentils also means you use less meat, which is good for you and the planet ? win, win! In return, Alex takes Buddy to train on the ice, teaching him the skills to skate forwards, backwards, stop and build up some speed ? and how to style it out when you fall over! It turns out that the key to good form is making lemons with your feet ? so there?s more in common with the kitchen than Buddy thought! Join Buddy, Conker and Alex as they glide through the recipe and ice rink in a super-tasty episode of Cooking Buddies! You can get all of Buddy?s recipes, and loads more, at bbc.co.uk\/food.
