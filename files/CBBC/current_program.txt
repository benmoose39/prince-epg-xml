Danny and Mick
The leisure centre is hosting a roller disco later that afternoon and Joy tells Danny and Mick if they want to be at the disco they need to finish every job on her list first. Danny spots a way to get some skating practice in and finish the jobs in double quick time ? by doing all their work on wheels! Unfortunately, when a runaway Danny crashes through the disco it looks like the whole thing might be off. Can Mick save the day.
