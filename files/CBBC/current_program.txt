Horrible Histories
A look at the hideous history of health, from the invention of toilet paper to the healthy origins of the cornflake. Along the way we discover that the Mayans believed that drinking wee could cure all ills, that the Tudors had to teach themselves how to swim again (everyone had forgotten), Victorians had a taste in beauty products that was literally shocking, and we take an in-depth look at Louis XIV's bottom problems.
