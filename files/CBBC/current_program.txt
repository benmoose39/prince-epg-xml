Operation Ouch!
The doctors take a dip in the sea to reveal how your sensory neurons detect when something is hot or cold, and they find themselves getting stuck in the mud when they join Her Majesty's Coastguard in Operation Takeover. Meet two more new Ouch Patients and find out what to do if someone is unresponsive and not breathing in First Aid. Meanwhile, in accident and emergency, one patient arrives with a broken arm after an accident on a trampoline and another is treated for a busted thumb.
