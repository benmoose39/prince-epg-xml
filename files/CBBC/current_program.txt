DIY Deadly with Steve Backshall
In this episode, Steve delves into the lives of perhaps the most popular of all deadly animals - the fast-striking, super-sinuous slithering snakes. Steve is wowed by a grass snake?s hunting technique, shows us how to work out whether an adder is male or female, and explains what to do to attract snakes to your green space! In a DIY demo, Steve gives us a privileged view of one of his most prized possessions ? a puff adder skeleton in all its glory! We see that this venomous viper can strike in the blink of an eye, and that corn snakes are awesome pets.
