Operation Ouch!
Identical twin doctors Dr Chris and Dr Xand van Tulleken show how incredible the human body is. With big stunts and exciting experiments, the doctors explore the extraordinary ways our bodies work and show how medicine can fix us when things go wrong. And in a new mind-bending strand, the medical twins test out psychological tricks on an unsuspecting public. The doctors reveal what happens when you get diarrhoea, Dr Xand gets his skates on when he meets Alexia and Kloe from CBBC's Ice Stars to investigate how they spin without getting dizzy, and there's a hidden camera experiment. Meanwhile, the ouch-mobile is open for more medical mysteries, and in accident and emergency one patient needs surgery for a broken arm and another gets help with a painful toe.
