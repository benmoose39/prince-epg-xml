When Dr Chris realises that the horrendous cheesy smell in the lab is coming from Dr Xand?s feet, the race is on to find out why they are so pongy. Is it the feet, the sweat, the trainers?! Turns out it isn?t as simple as you might think! Elsewhere, Dr Dan and Dr Raf square up in Body Battles as they put their quad muscles to the test by trying to squat to lay an egg in a nest. Thankfully, Gladiator Dynamite is there to stop anyone cracking up and make sure that the loser gets in the ice bath.

In Doctors on Duty, Dr Xand goes to hospital with Maddox, who has an appointment at the cystic fibrosis clinic at the Royal Brompton.
