My Life
Fourteen-year-old Mae is fed up with people misunderstanding autism and has created a guide to try and help people understand. The guide teaches us that everyone with autism is different and not to make assumptions. Mae also shows that they can be affectionate, like being who they are, and that it's ok to be different.
