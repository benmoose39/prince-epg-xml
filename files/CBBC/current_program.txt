Cooking Buddies
Buddy and Conker invite BMXer Lakey to their kitchen den to cook a meal that will super-charge her energy to race. Ranked at an amazing number 10 in the British Championships Girls under 10s, Lakey is a whizz on the racetrack. Buddy shows her how to make healthy chicken breasts, served with fresh pasta to give them loads of energy, cutting out their own shapes in a cool hack to personalise their pasta and bring it all together with a delicious homemade pesto with added peas ? it?s a chicken pea-sto pasta! In a handbrake turn, they leave the kitchen and head to the BMX racetrack where Lakey teaches Buddy how to set off properly at the start of a race, how to squash and pop on the track and to corner properly to shave off time. Join Buddy, Conker and Lakey in a race to the finish line as they get first prize in the kitchen! You can get all of Buddy?s recipes, and loads more, at bbc.co.uk\/food.
