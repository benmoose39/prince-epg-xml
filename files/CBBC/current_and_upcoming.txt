Danger Mouse and Penfold accompany Professor Squawkencluck to the Brainiac Symposium - the annual science convention, where King Kong Brunels's latest misfiring invention, the Cow Trainer, reminds his fellow boffins exactly why he is the laughing stock of the scientist community. When King Kong Brunel suggests that the Professor's success is all due to her privileged life as Danger Agency lab technician with scientist parents, an irked Squawk uses Brunel's Cow Trainer to swap bodies with him in order to show that she could be just as successful in his shoes. However, she soon finds that life as King Kong Brunel is as dispiriting as he makes out, as she is laughed out of the symposium when masquerading as her simian adversary. Elsewhere, an opportunistic King Kong Brunel finds himself revelling at playing Squawk, as finds he himself inside her lab having hitched a lift back to HQ with an unwitting Danger Mouse and Penfold. On discovering the truth, Danger Mouse and Penfold have the body- swapper turned on them, as KKB escapes back to the convention with his newly acquired Squawk-shaped credibility, and a new invention so poorly put together that it could end the world.
