OOglies
The OOglies slip, slide and splat all over the place. This fast-paced, madcap stop-motion animation uncovers the mischief everyday household objects get up to when no-one is looking. The band get a new trumpet player, with disastrous consequences. Also, the apple dropouts hatch an explosive plan to break free, and superhero Slippery Nana comes to the rescue to save a tomato... sort of! Deep in the back of the fridge, Frankfurter's monster is on the rampage, and Dr Rhu-barb surprises the judges with his white rabbit trick in the talent show.
