Horrible Histories
Charles Darwin presents a special show, as Horrible Histories takes a timely look at our planet and how we?ve behaved towards it throughout history. We look at how we?ve not always treated the planet's resources with the utmost care, from the 19th-century gold rush, to Henry VIII enjoying a little too much deforestation to build his warships In The Gone Show, we meet a range of animals that have recently become extinct, and we see how mankind has tried to work with and shape the land, from the earliest guides to farming to the fabulous Gardens of Versailles In Historical Educating, head teacher Mrs Thomas has trouble with her geography supply teachers (a Greek philosopher and a Viking), who seem intent on telling their pupils that the Earth is not round. We reveal that plastic bags were originally invented to save the planet, and in Time Beefs, Judge Rinder settles a dispute between environmentalist Rachel Carson and the businessmen who tried to stop her.

When Danger Mouse makes short work of Burt Badboy and his newly acquired band of fanatical feline followers, the group's leader Mandy and her cult of cats immediately trade in their colourful mohican hairstyles for eyepatches and become Danger Mouse worshippers. At first Danger Mouse is having too much fun to take notice of Penfold's warnings about his new-found cult status, but even he is forced to act when the cats follow his example a little too literally and live life a little too dangerously. Danger Mouse's attempt to disown the cats goes down like a lead balloon, and they use mouse-fu skills and a superpowered amulet stolen from Tutenkamoo to show their idol the error of his ways. Danger Mouse battles the frenzied feline onslaught and saves HQ from becoming a giant scratching post. However, this only reaffirms the idea that he is the chosen one in the minds of Mandy and the cult of cats. Danger Mouse realises that the only solution is to find a new obsession for the cats.
