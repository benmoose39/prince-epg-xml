DIY Deadly with Steve Backshall
In this unprecedented time of lockdown there has never been a better time to learn about the wildlife around us, and Deadly 60 fans have been sending in their videos, photos and questions for Steve Backshall to answer. In this episode, Steve focuses on our parks and gardens. This green space may look pristine, but for wildlife it?s savannah, jungle and mountains all rolled in to one. And judging by CBBC?s most observant viewers, its packed full of deadly animals! Steve unravels the mystery of some blue eggs in a nest, explains how a spider uses camouflage and trickery to lure in its prey, and tells about a worm that isn?t a worm... it?s a lizard! In a DIY demo, Steve then shows us how to keep hedgehogs warm and toasty during winter by building a hibernation house. But that?s not all. The audience gets their chance to ?beat Backshall? in a 60-second quickfire round. The question is, how many can Steve get right before his time is up?

My Life
Twelve-year-old Laleeyah lives on the Crow Creek Native American reservation in South Dakota, USA. There aren?t many opportunities for people on the reservation, and life can be tough, but Laleeyah loves to learn about the traditions of her ancestors and takes pride in keeping them alive. Once a year there is the Pow Wow: a big, colourful, celebration where the whole Crow Creek tribe comes together to compete and celebrate with traditional dancing, music and dress. For several years running Laleeyah has been crowned Junior Miss Crow Creek - the best young dancer on the reservation. But since the last Pow Wow she has developed an illness called hyperthyroidism, which makes her feel weak and tired. As she comes to terms with her illness, Laleeyah still wants to hold on to the things she loves most: dancing, representing her tribe, and her crown. But will she have what it takes, and can she still be the dancing queen.

Dr Rhu-barb is under attack from his arch-enemy, who is trying to 'extermi-grate' him, and a piece of toast impresses the judges with fire-juggling tricks at the talent show.
