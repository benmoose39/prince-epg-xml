    <desc>Greedy Grandmaster Glitch has been gorging on chocolate and wants more! The Grimbots discover a place called the Chocolate Hills on Bohol Island in the Philippines and take him there. The Chocolate Hills were created over thousands of years by water and wind eroding the rock, making a hilly landscape. Grass and ferns grow all over the hills and during the dry season they turn a chocolatey brown colour, making it look like the hills are covered in chocolate! The Go Jetters are also heading to the Chocolate Hills, but when they get there they are shocked to discover that the hills are covered in real chocolate. Glitch has turned the Chocolate Hills into a chocolate theme park.</desc>
