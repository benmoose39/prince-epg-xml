    <title>Go Jetters</title>
    <desc>Inspired by the statue of the Giant Buddha of Leshan, Ubercorn teaches the Go Jetters all about mindfulness to help them to concentrate, be calm and be kind to each other. They go to visit the massive thousand-year-old statue in China, which is carved into the mountainside by a river. Meanwhile, Grandmaster Glitch wants to have a statue of himself, but the Grimbots have made it too small. He takes them to Leshan to the Giant Buddha statue to show them how big his statue should be! But when he builds a giant viewing platform on top of a boat, he loses control of the boat and causes a whirlpool, putting the statue, tourists and himself at risk.</desc>
