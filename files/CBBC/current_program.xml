He gets some fantastic views of this king of the ocean, and to demonstrate their awesome hunting prowess, he has a special trick up his sleeve. Just as feared by many is the Cape buffalo, known locally as the black death. Steve takes to the skies to track down a huge herd of this notoriously bad-tempered bovine beast before being charmed by the snake-stomping secretary bird.</desc>
