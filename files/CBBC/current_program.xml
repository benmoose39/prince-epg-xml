    <title>Deadly 60</title>
    <desc>The action shifts to Steve's home turf as the Deadly 60 team scour the UK in search of its lethal beauties. Terry Nutkins lends a helping hand in spotting otters and tells Steve the story of how he lost two fingers to one of these creatures. A bit of pond-dipping reveals a whole host of the nasties ready to bite, maim and generally eat each other, and Steve gets a chance to meet with the biggest spider in the UK. Then it's off for a high-speed chase as Steve plays pigeon for the afternoon and nearly loses his head whilst being hunted by the fastest animal on the planet, the truly incredible peregrine falcon.</desc>
