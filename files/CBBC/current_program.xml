    <title>Go Jetters</title>
    <desc>Grandmaster Glitch has taken his teddy, Cuddles, to Ilulissat in Greenland to show him the sights, but Cuddles falls out of Grim HQ and gets stuck in the snow. The Grimbots melt the ice around Cuddles, and Glitch then uses Grim HQ to pull up the massive chunk of ice and carry it into the air. The Go Jetters are also in Ilulissat trying to spot some whales. They learn that Ilulissat means iceberg and that an iceberg is a huge chunk of ice which forms on land and then breaks off into the sea. Just then, Glitch's heavy iceberg falls from Grim HQ and starts sliding down the hill towards the town. The Go Jetters need to stop it and protect the town.</desc>
