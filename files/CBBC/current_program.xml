    <title>Go Jetters</title>
    <desc>The Go Jetters have been invited by the Korowai tribe to visit their village in the rainforest of Papua in Indonesia. They are an ancient tribe who build their homes above the ground, safe from floods and insects, using everything around them in the forest. Meanwhile, Grandmaster Glitch is also in the rainforest, trying to build the tallest treehouse in the world. When he sees that the Korowai's treehouse is even taller than his, he tries to get his even higher. But Glitch has built his treehouse from metal, not from things found in the forest, and his treehouse is not safe..</desc>
