    <desc>Cam, Tyler and Aaron explore the wonders of the wetlands and meet the wildlife heroes working hard to help protect its animal inhabitants. It?s an early start for Tyler as he heads to Devon hoping to bump into a beaver and discover why this furry eco engineer is having a huge impact on the land and its wildlife. Cam is on the outskirts of Manchester to lend a hand restoring a wetland habitat that is helping combat climate change, all thanks to a super-plant called sphagnum moss. On the Isle of Mull, the OZT brothers go head-to-head as they look to spot an otter. They find out how this wetland wonder is making a big comeback - but whose animal tracking skills will win the day? Back at OZT HQ, a mini murmuration of starlings is flying around, and Aaron is ready with some starling statistics, but he has the crowd guessing when it comes to playing Fact or Fake. Cam reveals an incredible scene from Sir David Attenborough?s Wild Isles and gives Tyler a real soaking as he demonstrates how they might film similar shots using a super slo-mo camera. And the brothers find out what has been going wild near you, in the OZT Gallery.</desc>
