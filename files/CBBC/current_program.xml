    <desc>It?s literally a packed show as the OZT HQ is crammed full of some of the fastest-swimming marine life and deepest divers surrounding Britain?s shores. Tyler takes the plunge in Plymouth to reveal how a special marine plant is being brought back from the edge of extinction to help fight climate change. Plucking up courage, he then dives deep to swim with sharks and is amazed by what he discovers about this incredible but sometimes misunderstood species. Just off Britain?s north east coast, Cam also slips into his wetsuit to go snorkelling with seal whisperer Ben. Getting up close with some inquisitive seals, he learns of the threats they face from plastic pollution. It?s all eyes on the Scottish skies as the OZT brothers go on a mission to the Isle of Mull to look for the ultimate soaring sea bird, the white-tailed eagle - but who will spot one first, and can Cam get the perfect picture? Back at OZT HQ, Aaron?s animal knowledge gets put to the test with some quickfire questions from the OZT crew, and Cam reaches for the sky with a drone to reveal how the incredible killer whale shots were filmed for Sir David Attenborough?s Wild Isles.</desc>
