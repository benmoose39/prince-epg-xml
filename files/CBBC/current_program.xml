Together, they bring us a collection of some of the best songs of this series, plus new material from some of the famous historical faces we meet along the way. Queen Elizabeth I, Mary I, Mary Queen of Scots and Lady Jane Gray - aka supergroup The Tudor Queens - are here to sing about having 'the power', before Elizabeth I tells us about using an astrologer for advice during her reign. The romantic poets (Wordsworth, Keats, Mary Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron) sing about their love for nature, while Lord Byron takes time out of his roguish schedule to tell us about one of his favourite fashion accessories. Elsewhere, Queen Victoria sings about her many prime ministers in Mambo Number 10, the GIs make a musical entrance to British shores during World War Two, we take a look at Puritan dating in Court Me Maybe, top boyband The Founding Fathers make America great for the first time, and we finish with a barnstorming look at the Victorians? invention of cinema.</desc>
