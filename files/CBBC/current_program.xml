    <title>Boy Girl Dog Cat Mouse Cheese</title>
    <desc>After a bad haircut, Dog tries wearing a fancy tuxedo until his fur grows back. Unfortunately, his initial reaction to wearing clothes causes him and the gang to accidentally destroy the rich neighbour lady's fence. But while the others are forced to rebuild it, the neighbour lady gives tuxedo-clad Dog a pass, thinking someone of his style and class is too good for manual labor. Resentment grows as the gang breaks their backs in the hot sun while Dog lives the good life with the fancy lady. How long can this go on.</desc>
