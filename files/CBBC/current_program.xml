    <title>Deadly Dinosaurs with Steve Backshall</title>
    <desc>If you thought that dinosaurs were the most dangerous things in the Jurassic, think again! There was actually something way worse and far more deadly! In this episode, Steve goes on a mission to uncover what was deadlier than the dinosaurs - from massive monsoons and supersized sandstorms to ballistic bacteria and gory gas. And in an epic finale, Steve ends with a bang as he recreates the dinosaur-killing asteroid impact in an experiment that's second to none.</desc>
