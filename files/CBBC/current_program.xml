    <desc>Rattus has enlisted the help of Richie - the Horrible Histories songwriter - to help him present a special song-filled show by making every one of Rattus?s bits a song too! Rattus has even brought a triangle along with him to add some musical flair. Along the way, there is a gross song about boils, a tune about warring brothers and a fabulous footy tune. Queen Victoria takes a break by the ocean, and viewers learn why early police had a 'hard cops? life'. Plus, pay tribute to the NHS, and take a trip to the Tower of London.</desc>
