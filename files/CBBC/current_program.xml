    <title>Boy Girl Dog Cat Mouse Cheese</title>
    <desc>When Boy, Girl and Cheese learn that their animal siblings have a tough time going through life with their unwieldy tails, they want to understand what it's like. So Mouse builds them mechanical tails to wear, and the three soon learn just how hard it is to do simple tasks. However, they come to master their tails well enough to attend the Curling Tail festival, where all tailed animals celebrate themselves. But when the kids turn their tails to full power to fit in better, they go haywire! They're now in danger of ruining the festival and being discovered as frauds.</desc>
