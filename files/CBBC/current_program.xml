    <desc>Steve Backshall and the team brave the intense heat of the Arizona desert as they go in search of more incredible animals for the Deadly 60 list. In order to demonstrate the awesome hunting skills of the Harris hawk, Steve becomes their prey for the day. Some state-of-the-art technology helps Steve track down deadly rattlesnakes and a real monster. It is then off to the mountains in search of a very elusive cat, the cougar. After seeing pictures captured by remote cameras, the team know the cats are there, but can they find them.</desc>
