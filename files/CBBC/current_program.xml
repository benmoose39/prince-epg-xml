    <title>Deadly 60</title>
    <desc>Steve Backshall and the Deadly 60 team travelled to six continents in search of animals for Steve's Deadly 60 list. They saw creatures with killer teeth, claws, jaws and venom. In fact they met so many incredible critters on their travels that they couldn't fit them all on the Deadly 60 list. Steve didn't want his audience to miss out, so he has given them their own programme.</desc>
