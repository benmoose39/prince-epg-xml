    <desc>The Go Jetters travel to Algeria in north Africa to check out the ancient Timgad Ruins. Built by the Romans nearly 2,000 years ago, the city was built as a grid, with all the roads running in straight lines from north to south or from east to west. Meanwhile, Grandmaster Glitch's computer game controller has broken, so he is looking for a new one. When he sees the map of the Timgad Ruins on the ship's big screen, he realises that the grid layout makes it look just like a computer game.</desc>
