    <title>Deadly 60</title>
    <desc>Steve and the crew are back in South Africa, one of the deadly capitals of the world. He is taken out by the fastest feet on the planet when he goes up against a couple of cheetahs in a 'friendly' game of football, before heading out to see them in action in the wild. He also meets a monkey-snatching crowned eagle that uses its dagger-like rear talon to snatch up unsuspecting treetop primates. Steve turns the latest camera technology on a trio of Africa's deadliest snakes, giving a unique view of the venom-spitting cobra, the supersensitive boomslang and the split-second striking puff adder.</desc>
