    <title>Operation Ouch!</title>
    <desc>What would it look like if a lifetime?s tears fell in one massive drop? That?s what Dr Chris and Dr Xand are determined to find out in Don?t Try This at Home! Gladiator Dynamite is back to put Dr Dan and Dr Raph?s lungs to the test in an unusual Body Battle. In Investigation Ouch, Dr Xand makes a poo donation in the name of medical science, and minds are bent by Dr Chris and Dr Xand, who use pictures by the mysterious street artist Xandsy to trick the eyes and brains of passers-by. At the emergency department in Liverpool, Elinor arrives with a knee injury after falling during a hurdles race at her athletics club, and Naveah has accidentally swallowed a 20 pence piece on a visit to the swimming pool.</desc>
