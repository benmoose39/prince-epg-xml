    <title>Deadly 60</title>
    <desc>Naturalist Steve Backshall heads to the Bahamas in order to get up close and personal with a whole bunch of sharks. There are plenty of shark species to choose from and Steve has his work cut out deciding which ones are worthy of a place on his Deadly 60 list. Hooking up with shark scientists helps him decide and gives him an opportunity to release some baby sharks into the wild, and he learns how to hypnotise them with his bare hands. Getting mobbed by hungry reef sharks and swimming with a four-metre tiger shark are all in a day's work for Steve and the team.</desc>
