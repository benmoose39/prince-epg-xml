    <title>Tracy Beaker Returns</title>
    <desc>Four young people and their cynical care worker Denis arrive at the Dumping Ground after a fire at Burnywood. Carmen recognises Tyler, the young joker she blames for stealing her clothes when she was there - she wants revenge. Johnny takes a shine to Lizanne, who manipulates him into giving up his room for her. Rick is protective of Kitty, a shy girl Tracy resolves to bring out of her shell, despite being warned of Kitty's unpredictable behaviour. When a fire breaks out in the attic, Tracy and Gus set about discovering who the culprit is.</desc>
