    <title>Tracy Beaker Returns</title>
    <desc>It's rewards time again - the annual event at the town hall at which all the local young people in care get an award for the one thing that makes them special. Tracy's doing the certificates for the Dumping Ground, but can't think of one for Johnny. She asks Tee to help, but Johnny overhears them discussing his lack of special qualities.</desc>
