    <title>Zagazoo</title>
    <desc>A tale from Quentin Blake's Box of Treasures. Happy couple Bella and George are surprised to receive a strange parcel containing a baby named Zagazoo, who unexpectedly transforms into a series of badly behaved animals, including a vulture, an elephant, a warthog and a hairy monster, mirroring the various tricky stages of childhood and testing their parental skills to the limit as they try to adapt to their challenging offspring. A touching and hilarious story about growing up and the bond of love that keeps a tight family together.</desc>
