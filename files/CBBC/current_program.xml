    <title>Boy Girl Dog Cat Mouse Cheese</title>
    <desc>With Boy's new help-for-hire business booming, he overworks his unpaid employee, Dog, without realizing. Dog is too loyal to say no, but he's miserable, especially when his next job is walking some mean cats. Girl sets out to teach Dog a lesson about standing up for himself, pretending to lose the cats to make Dog realize he should have said no to Boy, which will teach him to do just that in the future! But when the cats really go missing, they frantically set out to find them before Boy's business is ruined.</desc>
