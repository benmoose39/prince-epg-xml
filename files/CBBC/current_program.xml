    <title>Deadly 60</title>
    <desc>Steve and the team head to New Zealand for the first time. Steve descends deep into the Waitomo caves to find an unusual predator that lures insects to their death with a lethal lightshow, the glow-worm. Then he heads to South Island, to get an aerial view of one of the biggest animals on earth, the sperm whale, before driving inland to meet a very curious bird armed with deadly intelligence. The kea may be just a parrot, but its big brain makes it a hunter to be reckoned with. Finally, Steve returns to the ocean in search of sperm whales, and uses his kayak to get an awe-inspiring close view of this leviathan of the deep.</desc>
