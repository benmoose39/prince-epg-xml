    <desc>Ricky's nan has bought him some driving lessons because she thinks he's too old to ride a skateboard. Unfortunately Ricky's not keen and despite the best efforts of his friends and family he won't budge out of neutral. The art is still full-throttle though, with a self-propelling car and a human moped animation, and when they get to the driving centre, Ricky makes epic 3D art with traffic cones that will definitely pass the test.</desc>
