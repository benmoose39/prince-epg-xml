    <title>Deadly 60</title>
    <desc>Steve Backshall finds himself quite literally in deep water as he goes in search of underwater animals for his Deadly 60 list. The idyllic waters off the coast of Borneo hide a wealth of lethal predators, but just who is worthy of a place on the list? Camouflage, stealth and serious weaponry are the order of the day as Steve comes face to face with a highly venomous scorpion fish and witnesses the formidable spear mantis impaling its supper with its retractable spear-like arms. Just when Steve thinks he has seen it all, he finds himself surrounded by a gigantic shoal of barracuda in one of the most awesome animal encounters of the series.</desc>
