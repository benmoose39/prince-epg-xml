    <title>Deadly 60</title>
    <desc>Steve is on his home turf, scouring land, sea and air for some of the deadliest critters that the UK has to offer. First, he heads for the seas off the coast of Plymouth in search of monsters from the deep. And he's not disappointed! In the bowels of a wreck he comes face to face with a giant conger eel, one of the most feared predators in the ocean. Back on land he meets a double deadly killer, the dragonfly. As adults they are amazing aerial assassins, but they lead a double life. Before they emerge as elegant winged beauties, the larvae are terrors of the underwater world, impaling their unsuspecting prey with their alien-like double-hinged jaws. Finally, with the aid of a giant vertical wind tunnel, Steve tries to hover like a kestrel, one of the prettiest but fiercest falcons.</desc>
