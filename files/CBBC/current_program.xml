    <desc>When Mom and Dad's vacation plans get cancelled, they decide to take the whole family on a getaway to wherever they'd like! The kids decide to vote on where to go, but Cheese deceives her family and tricks them into going to a spa instead of the theme park they originally wanted to go to. After realizing how selfish she's been, Cheese decides it's up to her to save what's left of the family vacation.</desc>
