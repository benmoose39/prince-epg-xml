    <title>Octonauts</title>
    <desc>Join Captain Barnacles and his intrepid band of explorers, The Octonauts, for more deep sea adventures. The Octonauts roam the oceans in search of adventure and fun. Whether it's a perilous voyage to the bottom of the sea or the piratey pursuit of a giant squid, the Octonauts leap into action and always prove that eight heads are better than one. While exploring a dark and spooky cave, the Octonauts discover the fossil of a powerful, prehistoric fish... but it may be more than just a fossil.</desc>
