    <title>Danger Mouse</title>
    <desc>Having put the Danger Babies through their adorable paces, Professor Squawkencluck leaves it to Danger Mouse to settle them down with a nice soothing story. Unfortunately telling stories to children isn't one of Danger Mouse's strong points, and he ends up scaring his captive audience with a tale that reimagines him as an evil villain. Squawk returns to find Danger Mouse bound and gagged and that the Danger Babies have made off with the Danger Car and are on their way to Arkwirght Asylum to free the 'heroes' from Danger Mouse's topsy-turvy story.</desc>
