    <title>Deadly 60</title>
    <desc>Wildlife expert Steve Backshall meets one of the planet's ultimate killers, the saltwater crocodile, as the Deadly 60 team land in Australia's Northern Territories. A rogue croc is terrorising local fisherman, so it is time to lend the park rangers a hand in catching and relocating this prehistoric monster. Steve heads deep into an abandoned mine on a ghost hunt. He is on the search for ghost bats, awesome creatures with huge fangs, that drop on to their prey out of the night sky. Scary stuff, and a first for the Deadly team as these bats have never been filmed in the wild before.</desc>
