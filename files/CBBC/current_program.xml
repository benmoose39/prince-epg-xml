    <title>Operation Ouch!</title>
    <desc>In Ouchology, the doctors end up in a ball-throwing fight with their kid quizmasters, and it all ends with a snot, snot, snotting! Dr Xand rolls out the crushing machine in the lab to do an experiment to find out how strong your teeth are. It?s a packed Ouch and About, with George wanting to know why we burp, Clark asking why we need to sleep, and Ana asking why people have different eye colours. We fly across New South Wales, Australia, with Jesse and the Flying Doctors, to attend his hospital appointment in Sydney. In the emergency department, Nathan has an injured arm after jumping off the slide at Edinburgh Zoo and accidentally landed it, and Isabella is there after bending her finger backwards when catching the ball in Gaelic football practice.</desc>
