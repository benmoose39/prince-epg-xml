    <title>Octonauts</title>
    <desc>The Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest structure of living organisms at 1,400 miles long, is home to the most diverse population of undersea life on the planet, and it's under attack! In an epic story torn from the headlines, the Octonauts embark on their largest, most complex rescue mission ever - saving the Great Barrier Reef and all the creatures that live there from an invasion of coral-hungry crown-of-thorns starfish. The Octonauts meet a tiny coral polyp looking to find a home on the very same reef where the Octonauts are deploying their new medical base, the Gup-W, and the Gup-P, a specialised first responder emergency vehicle. To save the reef and their new polyp friend, the Octonauts must combine forces with a diverse crew of zapping, splatting and claw-snapping reef creatures to fend off the spiky, coral-munching starfish.</desc>
