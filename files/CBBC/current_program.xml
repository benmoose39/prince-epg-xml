    <title>Go Jetters</title>
    <desc>The Go Jetters are visiting the Everglades National Park in Florida, USA. It's an area made up mainly of water with amazing wildlife living there, including alligators! The Go Jetters are working with a local park ranger to put up signs warning people not to eat food near the water as it might attract the alligators. Meanwhile, Grandmaster Glitch is also at the Everglades enjoying a holiday with his Grimbots. He decides to stop and have a picnic by the water, which brings the alligators dangerously close to him and a boat full of tourists. It's down to the Go Jetters and the park ranger to save the day.</desc>
