    <title>Deadly 60</title>

But the first animal on the list is a complete surprise, a monster fish with two rows of sharp fangs that certainly keeps Steve on his toes. The crew find themselves up to their armpits in a swamp hoping to find a deadly snake with the unusual name of cottonmouth. Last but not least, Steve and his team come face to face with an enormous record-breaking predatory turtle.</desc>
