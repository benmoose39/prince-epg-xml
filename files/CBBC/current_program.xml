    <title>Deadly 60</title>
    <desc>Naturalist Steve Backshall's quest to meet 60 of the deadliest animals on the planet takes him to India. He is on the trail of the saw-scaled viper, said to be the deadliest snake on earth and responsible for 50,000 human deaths each year. It might seem that putting it on the Deadly 60 list is a formality but, in a country famous for enormous snakes, Steve discovers that it has plenty of competition. The sloth bear seems an unlikely candidate for the Deadly 60 until it becomes clear that it has razor sharp claws and an incredibly powerful jaw, attributes that do not go unnoticed by Steve as he gets a little too close to one of them. Steve puts his martial arts skills to good use as he tries praying mantis kung fu in an attempt to get to grips with an insect with one of the fastest strikes around.</desc>
