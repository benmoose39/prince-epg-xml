    <title>One Zoo Three</title>
    <desc>It?s the zoo?s grand reopening and the boys are preparing to open the gates to the public for the first time. The night before, they were rudely awoken, and Moto the lion took the opportunity to investigate what the animals get up to during the dead of night. Cam draws the short straw and has to clean out the camel enclosure, while Billy the ocelot is given a pungent treat to play with and the boys recall the extraordinary story of how the zoo was started. Meanwhile, the brothers catch up on when they met with rangers on the front line training to intercept and arrest wildlife poachers.</desc>
