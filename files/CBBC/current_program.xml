    <title>Pok?mon: Black and White</title>
    <desc>A vast Pok?mon habitat amid the hustle and bustle of the big city seems like the perfect new home for a group of five Genesect. The arrival of these mythical Pok?mon quickly becomes a problem, though, as their nest threatens the city?s power supply and they keep attacking anyone who approaches it. On top of that, they have attracted the attention of the legendary Pok?mon Mewtwo, who sympathizes with them because its own origins also involve human tampering. Their leader, a red Genesect, doesn?t trust Mewtwo, and their confrontation quickly rages out of control! Can Ash and his friends stop these two powerful Pok?mon before they destroy the city.</desc>
