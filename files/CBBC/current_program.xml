    <title>Mrs Armitage on Wheels</title>
    <desc>A tale from Quentin Blake's Box of Treasures. Inventor extraordinaire Mrs Armitage and faithful dog Breakspear love adventurous hobbies like skydiving until an accident dents Mrs Armitage?s confidence. Recovered, she plans a short cycling trip, but keeps putting it off adapting her bike with horns, a tool kit, and even a sail! The ?land yacht? eventually launches, but a further accident leaves Mrs Armitage doubly nervous. Luckily, her Uncle Cosmo comes to the rescue gifting Mrs Armitage his old car and getting her finally back on the road.</desc>
