    <title>Go Jetters</title>
    <desc>When a storm washes up lots of plastic litter onto the Go Jet Academy beach, the Go Jetters leave Ubercorn, Grandmaster Glitch and the cadets behind and head to the Pacific Ocean to try to solve the problem of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. This is a massive collection of plastic garbage which has gathered together and floats in the ocean. It causes big problems for animals and sea birds which live in the oceans as they can eat the garbage or get tangled up in it. Sorting this out is going to be the Go Jetters' biggest challenge yet.</desc>
