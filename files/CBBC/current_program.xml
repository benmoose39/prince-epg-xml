    <desc>Grandmaster Glitch has been invited to Djenn? in Mali, Africa, to visit the people and to see one of his favourite things at work - mud! He is especially impressed by the spectacular Great Mosque of Djenn?, the largest structure made from mud in the world. But mud brings problems, and during the rainy season the rain causes damage to the walls of the mosque and the mud houses, so the local people get together to help repair them. Glitch wants to help, but when he realises they have to do this job every single year, he makes a massive umbrella to try to keep the mosque dry so that the local people don't have to repair it again. Although Glitch was only trying to help, things start to go wrong. The huge Grimbrella swings too close to the mosque and goes out of control. The Go Jetters need to fix that Glitch.</desc>
