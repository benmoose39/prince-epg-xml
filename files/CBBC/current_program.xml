    <title>Deadly 60</title>
    <desc>In the medieval Ethiopian city of Harar, Steve Backshall has a unique and potentially lethal encounter with a pack of spotted hyenas. Capable of tearing their prey apart with super-strong jaws and thick muscular bodies, here they are hand-fed, allowing Steve the encounter of a lifetime with this normally unapproachable predator. Heading out of the town and up into the mountains, Steve meets the rarest wolf on earth and discovers why a grass-munching monkey, the gelada baboon, has a set of teeth that would make a vampire jealous.</desc>
