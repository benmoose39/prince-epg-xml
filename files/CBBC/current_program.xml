    <title>Shark Bites</title>
    <desc>This time on Shark Bites, Steve Backshall meets the snappiest shark in our seas. The lemon shark scours the sandy seabed for food, but how does it get a good grip on hidden prey? Steve heads to the Bahamas in the Caribbean to dive with these feisty sharks. He heads down on his dive with a time slice rig to film the lemon shark's bite in three dimensions before heading into his shark lab to analyse it.</desc>
