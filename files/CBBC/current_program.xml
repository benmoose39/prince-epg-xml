    <desc>Jack is just 13 years old, but he is already one of the best young darts players in the world. As the British youth darts champion, he has his sights set on an even bigger title: world champion. Jack travels to Gibraltar for the World Junior Open, where he will compete both in the singles and as part of the England squad. However, the road to victory won?t be easy, as Jack has previously lost a world final against Luke Littler, who has since gone on to become professional world champion at just 17. Can Jack turn the tables and bring home the gold? We follow Jack as he trains, competes and faces off against his biggest rivals, including his England teammate Archie, currently ranked number one in the world. With fast-paced action, nail-biting matches and the pressure of playing for his country, we follow the highs and lows of Jack?s road to the top.</desc>
