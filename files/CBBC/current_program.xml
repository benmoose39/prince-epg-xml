    <title>Super Happy Magic Forest</title>
    <desc>When Stinkweasel drops a rain of yukkiness onto the forest, the Fairy Squad, with their excellent flying skills, decide they are the ones for the job. However, Hoofius insists this should be their quest, even if he does hate ick! And when the Fairy Squad get their wings gunked and are unable to fly, the heroes can resume their quest to end Stinkweasel?s reign of stinky nonsense - no flying required.</desc>
