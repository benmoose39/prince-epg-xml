    <title>Tracy Beaker Returns</title>
    <desc>There is a fire in the attic. Denis blames Harry, who has built a den up there out of Sapphire's discarded junk. Refusing to see the Burnywood fire and this one as a coincidence, Tracy and Gus break into the sealed attic to get forensic evidence. Just as they find some discarded cigarette butts, Gus falls through the burned floor onto Carmen's bed. Denis blames Tracy for Gus's fall and sacks her. Meanwhile, Lizanne has turned her attentions to Frank, who 'loans' her money.</desc>
