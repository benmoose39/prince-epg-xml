    <title>Operation Ouch!</title>
    <desc>Dr Chris and Dr Xand delve into the Cupboard of Everything and find the Fart Machine 5000, to help them explain why farts can sound so different to each other. Turns out it?s a combination of gas pressure along with sphincter and buttock tightness that determines whether your fart is a trump or a squeak. And on the Fart Machine 5000, those settings are all adjustable, so the doctors get ready to make a bum noise symphony! When the farts have stopped, it?s time to meet some of our new Ouchers, so let us introduce you to Elyana and her hearing dog, Gordon, and Alfie, who likes planes and canoeing. Dr Ronx explains hiccups in Ouch and About. Together with Dr Chris and Dr Xand, Dr Ronx is using only touch to solve a medical mystery in Ouchology, in the hope of avoiding a snotting. At the emergency department in Liverpool, Maya has injured her knee playing rugby. While in Edinburgh, Reuben has pushed a sewing needle right into his finger.</desc>
