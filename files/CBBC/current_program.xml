    <title>Deadly Dinosaurs with Steve Backshall</title>
    <desc>Steve is on a mission to find the weirdest dinosaur ever. He kick-starts with Gigantoraptor, an eight-metre-tall giant that laid the biggest eggs in history. Then, courtesy of a monster truck crash, he meets the miniscule Magyarosaurus. But that's not freaky enough, so finally he focuses on a dinosaur that head-butted its rivals to death - something Steve's hoping to replicate with the mother of all robots. Weird.</desc>
