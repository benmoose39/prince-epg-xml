    <desc>Nero heads to Hollywood to see if he can make his fame and fortune as a singer, dancer, rapper and all-round megastar. However, making it big in the Land of Opportunity is harder than he expected. He ends up living in a basement owned by the Tang Family, being represented by Hollywood?s worst most washed-up agent, and attending a college where he teaches a strand on British History ? a subject he knows nothing about. However, while Nero might not make it big he discovers a different kind of success with the friends and surrogate-family around him. Maybe this American adventure might just work out okay! Meanwhile, Owen and Eli try to make it from the UK to the USA to visit Nero. But a series of mishaps at the airport and on the plane mean their holiday doesn?t go entirely to plan? and they end up stranded in Alaska.</desc>
