    <desc>The OOglies slip, slide and splat all over the place. This fast-paced, madcap stop-motion animation uncovers the mischief everyday household objects get up to when no-one is looking. Star bar finds a new rocket to fly to the moon, the ninja sushi are attacking, and fearless Pete Parsnip comes face to face with some savage staplers. The cavemen mushrooms hide from the rampaging plant pots, the baby blocks have a little accident and a heavy metal watermelon wows the judges at the talent show.</desc>
