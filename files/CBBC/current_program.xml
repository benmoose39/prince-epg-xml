    <title>Deadly 60</title>
    <desc>Adventurer Steve Backshall and the Deadly 60 team pack their cold weather gear and head north to Alaska. They battle for days and nights in the freezing conditions of the frozen tundra, hoping to find polar bears to add to the list. They are rewarded with a rare sighting of a wolverine and some cheeky Arctic foxes. Steve has heard of a place where thousands of bald eagles arrive every year to feed on the spawning salmon. Keen to see them first-hand, he heads up one of the freezing rivers to get a closer look. Alaska is also home to the grizzly bear, and Steve won't be going home until he has seen one and added it to his list.</desc>
