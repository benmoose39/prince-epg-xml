    <title>The Next Step</title>
    <desc>A reality-style drama following the lives of a group of dancers at the Next Step Dance Studio as they attempt to win the regional dance championships. Giselle wants to make her mark in A-Troupe by doing a dangerous lift, but Daniel isn't so sure it is a good idea. Michelle thinks it's exactly what they need to get them to regionals and wants to help them, against Kate and Chris's wishes.</desc>
