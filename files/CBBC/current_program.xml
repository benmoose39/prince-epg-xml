    <title>The Gruffalo's Child</title>
    <desc>Animated film based on the best-selling children's picture book by author Julia Donaldson and illustrator Axel Scheffler. One wild and windy night, the Gruffalo's child ignores her father's warnings and bravely tiptoes out into the snow in search of the Big Bad Mouse. She meets Snake, Owl and Fox, but there is no sign of the fabled Mouse. He doesn't really exist... or does he.</desc>
