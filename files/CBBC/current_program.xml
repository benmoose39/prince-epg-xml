    <title>Horrible Histories</title>
    <desc>Horrible Histories pays tribute to Formidable Florence Nightingale, The Lady with the Lamp (just don't let Florence hear you calling her that!) The programme charts how Florence revolutionised medicine and the treatment of the sick during the Crimean War, but also how she also unwittingly sparked the public's desire for trinkets and tat featuring her image. Elsewhere, there's the bizarre practice of Victorian war tourism (tea, cake and carnage), a look at some Embarrassing Victorian Bodies, and a visit to Mary Seacole's British Hotel.</desc>
