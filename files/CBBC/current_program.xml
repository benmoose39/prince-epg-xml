    <title>Go Jetters</title>
    <desc>It's a whirlwind of windmill excitement as the Go Jetters travel to Kinderdijk in the Netherlands to celebrate National Mill Day. A lot of the Netherlands is below sea level and there is a high risk of flooding, so here at Kinderdijk, ditches and pumps are used to drain away the water. This used to be done by windmills using wind power, but nowadays the pumping stations are powered by diesel fuel or electricity, but the old windmills still work too! Whilst also flying over Kinderdijk, Grandmaster Glitch's Grim HQ runs out of fuel and crashes into the water. Furious, he sends the Grimbots off to find some fuel. They hook in to the Kinderdijk pumping station and start taking the fuel. Once they've taken all the diesel fuel for Grim HQ, the pump stops working and the water level rises, threatening to flood the area! The Go Jetters need to get the windmills going again to bring the water level back down.</desc>
