    <title>The Next Step</title>
    <desc>A reality-style drama following the lives of a group of dancers at the Next Step Dance Studio as they attempt to win the regional dance championships. Since everyone has been working so hard in prep for regionals, Kate and Chris hold a pizza party at the Next Step studio. Everyone has a good time getting to hang out as friends and not just dance mates.</desc>
