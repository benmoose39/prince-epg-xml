    <title>Deadly 60</title>
    <desc>The action shifts to Steve's home turf as the Deadly 60 team scour the UK in search of its lethal beauties. From the wild seas off the Pembrokeshire coast to the New Forest, Steve proves that British wildlife is anything but boring. Gannets prove to be more than a match for Steve in a diving competition. He battles with the elements to reach the birds but the rough seas are determined to stop him. He then has to confront his past as he comes face to face with the only venomous snake that has hospitalised him. The Deadly team also have a close call as they uncover a hornets' nest in a loft, and Steve gets a taste of what it is like to be prey for a day as he is hunted through a forest by a hungry goshawk.</desc>
