    <title>Operation Ouch!</title>
    <desc>In the last episode of the series, the doctors reveal the amazing strength of your jaw, and they see if they can take the heat when they try their hands at being hospital ward chefs in Operation Takeover. Dr Xand joins the ear, nose and throat department to see how they fix their patients, and Dr Chris hits the wards answering questions for one last time in Ouch and About On Call. Meanwhile, in accident and emergency, one patient is treated for an injury to her neck, and another has cut his foot on a tin lid.</desc>
