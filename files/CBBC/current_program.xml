    <title>Deadly 60</title>
    <desc>Wildlife presenter Steve Backshall is in India on the search for the biggest of all the big cats, the truly awesome tiger. With limited time in which to find such a rare and endangered animal, the Deadly 60 team are taking a huge risk. Steve needs the help of the locals, but who can help him sniff out these elusive felines? Enter the elephants. After several days of searching, the crew eventually get a sighting and the cameraman has a much closer encounter than anyone expected. Steve also comes face to face with another animal that is on the endangered list, the gharial crocodile. With its long snout and bulbous nose, it has to be one of the strangest crocodiles in the world.</desc>
