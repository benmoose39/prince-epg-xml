    <title>Room on the Broom</title>
    <desc>Animated film based on the wonderful children's picture book written by Julia Donaldson and illustrated by Axel Scheffler. A kind witch invites a surprising collection of animals to join her on her broom, much to the frustration of her cat. The gang ultimately saves the witch from a fearsome dragon, and in gratitude she rewards them with a magnificent new broom which has room for everyone. A magical tale about friendship and family from the producers of the hugely successful The Gruffalo and The Gruffalo's Child. Featuring the voices of Gillian Anderson (Witch), Rob Brydon (Cat), Martin Clunes (Dog), Sally Hawkins (Bird), Simon Pegg (Narrator), Timothy Spall (Dragon) and David Walliams (Frog).</desc>
