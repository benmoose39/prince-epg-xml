    <desc>The OOglies slip, slide and splat all over the place. This fast-paced, madcap stop-motion animation uncovers the mischief everyday household objects get up to when no-one is looking. The thrill-seeking eggs snowboard down the ironing board, the Stunt Tomato and his glamorous celery stick assistant attempt a death-defying stunt, and the apple dropouts come up with an explosive new way to break free. Mr and Mrs Strawberry stargaze with a little help from the gooseberry, and the mushroom cavemen attempt to wow the judges with their rock-balancing trick in the talent show.</desc>
