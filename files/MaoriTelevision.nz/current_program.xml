    <title>Red Shoes and the Seven Dwarfs</title>
    <desc>This fairy?tale spoof reimagines Snow White as ?Red Shoes,? who steals a magic pair of red shoes and transforms herself. When seven cursed princes (turned into green dwarfs) seek a kiss from the &quot;most beautiful woman&quot; to break their spell, they join forces with her to stop a wicked stepmother and reclaim their true selves. Themes include beauty, self-acceptance, and true love.</desc>
