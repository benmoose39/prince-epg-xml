However, when Max gets arrested and ends up helping Ellis solve a local crime, the two are offered the opportunity to redeem themselves, with Ellis becoming a detective again and Max staying out of jail. The catch? They must work together, with each using their unique skills to solve crimes. For Ellis, that means hard-boiled shoe leather police work; for Max, it means accents, schemes and generally befriending everyone in sight while driving Ellis absolutely nuts. The two will have to learn what it means to trust another person and maybe actually become partners.</div></div></div>
