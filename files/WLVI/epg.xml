    <desc>Before the age of 30, journalist and Emmy-winner Graham Bensinger worked not only for major networks like NBC and ESPN, but he also began his own syndicated interview program that airs weekly across the country. Bensinger chats with some of sports' biggest names, including pro football players Terrell Owens and Tony Romo, professional basketball player Kobe Bryant, boxing champion George Foreman and broadcaster Joe Buck. The half-hour show features sports stars discussing their lives and careers, including some controversial topics they would probably like to forget.</desc>
