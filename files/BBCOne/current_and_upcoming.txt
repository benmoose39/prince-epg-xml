Paranormal: Britain's Last Witch
There's only a handful of mediums worldwide who claim to do anything close to what Helen Duncan said she could and physically manifest spirits into a room. For Sian, the only way to fully understand what was happening at Helen's s?ances is to witness this for herself, so she tracks one of these rare mediums down in the Netherlands. Sian arrives at the Dutch monastery and is greeted by a host who takes Sian on a private tour of the s?ance room, where the medium will work that evening.

Sian's mission to get to the truth behind Helen Duncan's apparently supernatural abilities draws to a close - but a secret package sent from Helen's granddaughter in America leaves Sian with what appears to be the smoking gun she has been waiting for. The package contains what seems to be unexplainable proof that a 'spirit' revealed the sinking of a second warship during one of Helen's s?ances.
