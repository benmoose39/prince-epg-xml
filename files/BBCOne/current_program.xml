    <desc>Marvin and Rochelle Humes host this compulsively play-along music quiz. Contestants simply have to name hit songs and artists to win a possible ?10,000, but can they stay cool under pressure? The teams are best friends Izzy and Ellie from Sheffield, husband and wife Joy and Joe from Nottingham, and dad and son Tom and Paul from Liverpool, all hoping to hit the right note and win a chance to bag that cash prize. Get ready to play along and shout out the answers at the telly!</desc>
