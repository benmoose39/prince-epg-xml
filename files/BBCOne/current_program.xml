    <desc>The VE Day 80 celebrations continue at Westminster Abbey with a service of thanksgiving paying tribute to the sacrifice of the Second World War generation. Petroc Trelawny provides commentary from inside Westminster Abbey, leading us through the service, and invited guests share their memories. From the studio in St James's Park in London, Sophie Raworth is joined by special guests who share their experiences of the Second World War.</desc>
