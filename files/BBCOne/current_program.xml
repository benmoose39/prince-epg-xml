    <title>Escape to the Country</title>
    <desc>Having sold up his home in the large Bedfordshire town of Luton, today's buyer has already relocated to a rental in Derbyshire, but has called on the expertise of Sonali Shah to help him source his very own property in the countryside, where he can entertain family and friends. For a real flavour of local life, they sample traditional Bakewell puddings and tarts, as well as some exotic cuisine from much further afield.</desc>
