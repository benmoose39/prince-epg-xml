    <title>Bargain Hunt</title>
    <desc>Danny Sebastian hopes to strike the right chord when he learns about guitar making or 'lutherie'. In his workshop, Alex Bishop shows Danny how he makes gypsy jazz, acoustic and electric guitars - a process that takes him up to 200 hours. In Carmarthenshire, two teams are tuning up for a battle of the bargains. Sister act Natalie and Victoria are in red, guided by their expert Stephanie Connell. Their opponents in blue are married couple Oliver and Noi, helped by John Cameron.</desc>
