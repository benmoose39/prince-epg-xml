    <title>Garden Rescue</title>
    <desc>Charlie and Flo are in Southampton to transform Claire and her daughter Norah's small garden into a magical space where mum and daughter can spend quality time together. The challenge is that half the garden is taken up with a massive World War II bomb shelter, and Claire would love to be able to use the shelter as a play space full of fairy magic for Norah to enjoy. Can the Garden Rescue team achieve all this on a ?3300 budget?</desc>
