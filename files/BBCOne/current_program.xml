    <title>Escape to the Country</title>
    <desc>Steve Brown's escapees from a large Bedfordshire town want to relocate to the fabulous Fens to start a glamping business, so at least an acre of land is a priority. Steve also meets another couple who are about to start building the house of their dreams, recycling as many materials as they can from a derelict 250-year-old farmer's cottage and barn.</desc>
