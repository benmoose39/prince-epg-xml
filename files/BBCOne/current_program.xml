    <title>Bargain Hunt</title>
    <desc>In a very special show, Bargain Hunt commemorates the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. At the RAF Museum in London, Charlie Ross admires the planes that secured victory and pays tribute to the bravery of thousands of air crew whose names are etched on the Battle of Britain Memorial in Folkestone. The programme also revisits two teams in Lewes who were challenged to buy military items under the expert eye of Danny Sebastian and John Cameron.</desc>
