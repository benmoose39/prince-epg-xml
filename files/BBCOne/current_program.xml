    <title>The Bidding Room</title>
    <desc>Nigel Havers welcomes five more sellers to the Bidding Room, where they try to sell items to professional dealers who are on the lookout for interesting pieces, with help from expert Simon Bower. Shirley is first into the room today, hoping to sell a 19th-century music stool she's owned for 20 years. With no room to store it any longer, she's in search of a new owner. But will any of the dealers be playing to the tune of Simon's expert valuation?</desc>
