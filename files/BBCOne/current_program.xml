    <title>The Gruffalo's Child</title>
    <desc>This animated programme, based on a best-selling children's book, finds the Gruffalo living in a cave surrounded by woods. His child is getting to be the age at which she wants to go out and explore the world beyond their cave. But the Gruffalo has warned her not to go into the deep, dark woods and if she does, the Big Bad Mouse will be after her. On one wild and windy night, the Gruffalo's child ignores her father's warnings and bravely tiptoes out into the snow in search of the Big Bad Mouse. She meets malevolent Snake, pedantic Owl and cowardly Fox - but no sign of the fabled Mouse. He doesn't really exist - or does he?</desc>
