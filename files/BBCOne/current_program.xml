The All England Club has been a happy hunting ground for Czech-born players in the past, with Martina Navratilova, Petra Kvitova and Marketa Vondrousova among those to also win the women's singles title. It's been a tough season so far for Krejcikova, who has played sparingly due to a back injury.</desc>
