    <title>Walking With Dinosaurs</title>
    <desc>Utah, 130 million years ago. A band of armoured dinosaurs battle to reach adulthood, pursued by some of the most formidable predators that have ever lived: Utahraptors. It's a deadly game of cat-and-mouse that pits heavy armour against vicious claws and lethal cunning; a life-and-death struggle that builds to a final showdown amongst the flames of a burning forest.</desc>
