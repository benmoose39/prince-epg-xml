    <desc>Flo and Lee are in Bristol to convert Emi and Song's awkwardly shaped wrap-around garden into a Japanese and UK fusion garden. They would love the garden to draw on their combined Japanese heritage, as well as the UK, so it's a mix of planting with cherry trees, acers from Japan and English roses, with areas for their children to play, grow vegetables and to socialise. Can the team achieve all this on a ?5,000 budget?</desc>
