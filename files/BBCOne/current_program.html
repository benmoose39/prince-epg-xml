A covert surveillance operation by the National Crime Agency identifies the arms dealer and watches the group as they travel to and from Europe, bringing the weapons ashore in Kent. Also, a recording of a prison phone call leads to the moment of proof police need to convict a bank cashier who has helped steal an elderly couple's life savings.</div></div></div>
