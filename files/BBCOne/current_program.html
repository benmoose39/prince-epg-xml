Beryl's solitary behaviour is putting her in peril, as an unconfident member of the pride can be rejected. To ensure her standing in the group, the keepers have come up with a plan to elevate Beryl's status amongst the lionesses and build up her confidence. It's been three years since Europe's only southern koala breeding programme started, and Animal Park has followed every step of the phenomenal journey.</div></div></div>
