A man has been attacked and left for dead in a public park, but no-one knows who he is or how he got there. Police have no way of working out what has happened until they find the trolley. Also today, a pair of curtains, seen on a video call thousands of miles away, helps police identify a phone thief and put him behind bars.</div></div></div>
