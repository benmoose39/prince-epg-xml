Dee and Aaron saved for years to be able to afford their dream house together. But now with the addition of young children, four-year-old Zora and seven-month-old Elias, the clutter is clouding that dream. Stacey challenges the family to let go of half their belongings, paving the way for a beautifully reorganised and functional space.</div></div></div>
