Homes Under the Hammer
Dion is in Manchester to see a three-bed semi-detached house bought by a father-and-son property developing team. He's also in Sheffield, viewing an interesting commercial unit that was previously a photography studio. Martel is in Hartlepool to see a three-bed mid-terrace with a very low auction guide price.
