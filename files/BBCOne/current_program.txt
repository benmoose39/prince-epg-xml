The Moment of Proof
An airport hire car provides the clues to the identities of a pair of South African hitmen who have come to the UK to brutally murder a private investigator in his home. They escape afterwards, but vital evidence is left in the car which not only convicts them but the person who ordered the hit. Also, a rare bottle of Caribbean rum gives police the moment of proof they need to jail a prolific burglar who has been ransacking homes and stealing irreplaceable belongings.
