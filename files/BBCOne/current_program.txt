Defenders: Busting the Bad Guys
The Defenders set up a secret surveillance operation and uncover a shocking case of human trafficking and modern slavery. Scores of young men and women are kept as prisoners and forced into unpaid labour, working for nothing at a car wash in Bristol. They also investigate an online trader using the `dark web' to illegally sell potentially deadly diet pills.
