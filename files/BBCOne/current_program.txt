Shrek the Third
Shrek is just starting to settle down in his beloved swamp with his wife Fiona, but their mucky bliss doesn't last for long as word arrives that the ogre's froggy father-in-law is about to croak. The very last thing Shrek wants is to become King, but with no other heir in sight, it looks like the grumpy green one is destined never to live quietly in the swamp again. A glimmer of hope appears in the form of heir Artie. A DreamWorks animation.
