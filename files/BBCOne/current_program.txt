The Finish Line
Five contestants - Paula, Jamie, Katy, Dan and Kevin - battle across a series of fast-paced qualifiers and head-to-head races where the aim of the game is simple - make it to the finish line before your rivals. The winner then races against the track itself in an attempt to win the ?5,000 cash prize.
