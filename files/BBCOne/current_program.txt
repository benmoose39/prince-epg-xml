Escape to the Country
A couple from Reading in Berkshire want to escape and set up home in the Welsh Borders, somewhere with enough land to keep a menagerie of animals. Steve Brown helps them with the property search and takes them to an animal sanctuary to meet Burrito, a cuddle-loving donkey, as well as two pampered pigs, Wilbur and Uncle Watson.
