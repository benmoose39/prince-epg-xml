Calendar Girls
Based on the true story of 12 ladies from Yorkshire baring all for charity. When one of the women's husbands dies from leukaemia, they decide that their prim and proper fundraising efforts need a bit of a shake-up. They find a more compelling way to raise money - by starring in a nude calendar. Their modest hopes of selling a few hundred copies around the village are outstripped when it becomes a worldwide sensation.
