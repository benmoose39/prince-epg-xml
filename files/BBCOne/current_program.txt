Escape to the Country
Jules Hudson teams up with a calligrapher from East London who wants to write a new chapter in the West Country for her ?400k budget. When he's not presenting beautiful property, Jules also gets in tune with the region's nautical traditions and attends a sea shanty festival on the southern coast.
