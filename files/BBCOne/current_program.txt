Northwest 200 Motorcycle Racing
Every May, around 100 motorcycle road racers from across the world make the pilgrimage to Northern Ireland to take part in one of the sport's fastest and most dangerous events - the North West 200. Racing on closed public roads at speeds in excess of 200 mph, the riders dice with danger and even death. To outsiders, it looks like a form of madness. To those who do it, it's like their religion, and the road their church.
