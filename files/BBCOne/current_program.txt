Escape to the Country
There are grand ambitions in Norfolk as Alistair Appleton helps an opera singer and his husband find a house with space inside to hold small concerts and a garden big enough to keep a couple of pigs. During his time in the county, Alistair also meets a former fashion editor from London who uses social media to share the joys of her country life from her beautiful Georgian home.
