Bargain Hunt
Natasha Raskin Sharp and the teams head to an antiques fair in Builth Wells in Mid Wales. Experts Ben Cooper and Kate Bliss are on hand to help the reds and blues pick the best bargains to take to auction, and Natasha pays a visit to a special museum in Kidderminster to learn about the history of carpet-making in the Worcestershire town.
