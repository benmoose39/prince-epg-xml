Escape to the Country
Jules Hudson prepares himself for a beautiful but bracing property adventure in the lowlands of Scotland as he travels around the Lothians. He's with a buyer from Edinburgh who has a ?360k budget to make a longed-for break from the city and has brought her aunt along for support. Amongst a diverse range of property options, Jules also tours a striking fortified 16th-century tower that has been meticulously restored back into a great Scottish house.
