Homes Under the Hammer
Tommy is in Rugeley in Staffordshire to see a three-bed mid-terrace bought by a trio of experienced developers. Martin is in Cudham in the London borough of Bromley, visiting a two-bed end-terrace bought by a mother to help get her daughter on the property ladder. Jacqui is in north west London to see two flats that may be better reverting back to one.
