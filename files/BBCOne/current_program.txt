Alison has invited Lucy to come to Button House for a sleepover, but after a worrying meeting with the solicitor, Alison must work out if Lucy is really who she says she is. The Captain insists on utilising his skills in surveillance to help Alison find out the truth. After an emailing prank by Julian gets out of hand, Mike has some awkward explaining to do to his boss, which Julian and Robin are gleeful to have front row seats for.
