Escape to the Country
We visit the wonderful county of Suffolk, where a teacher is looking for somewhere to finally settle down after three decades travelling the world. She has a budget of ?350,000, her daughter by her side for support and Denise Nurse standing by with a selection of tempting property options. Denise also meets a couple who have made a sizzling success of their Suffolk move with a thriving barbecue business.
