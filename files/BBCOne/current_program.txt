The Weakest Link
Romesh Ranganathan is back quizzing eight celebrities who are all after a potential prize pot of ?50,000 for their charity. Initially working together, the celebrities must vote off the weakest link each round until just two remain in the head-to-head. But only one can claim the prize. The celebrity contestants are Keith Duffy, Rachel Riley, Amy Gledhill, Ching He Huang, Konan, Rory Bremner, Bonnie Langford and Chris Harris.
