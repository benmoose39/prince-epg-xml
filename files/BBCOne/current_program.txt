Attenborough and the Sea Dragon
On the Jurassic coast of Britain a remarkable 200-million-year-old fossil is discovered: the bones of an ichthyosaur, a giant sea dragon. David Attenborough joins the hunt to bring this ancient creature's story to life. Using state-of-the-art imaging technology and CGI, the team reconstruct the skeleton and create the most detailed animation of an ichthyosaur ever made.
