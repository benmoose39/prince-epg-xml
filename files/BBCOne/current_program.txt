Bargain Hunt
Yesterday's inventions have become today's design classics. That's what Caroline Hawley learns as she reveals some of the antiques bought on Bargain Hunt which were ahead of their time. In the Museum of Technology in Lincolnshire, Caroline charts the technological revolution from 1850 to 1980 and looks at the impact made by gadgets such as the Brownie camera, the Bakelite field telephone, the electric toaster and the first hairdryer.
