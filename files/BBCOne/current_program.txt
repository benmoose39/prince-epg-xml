Match of the Day 2
Mark Chapman presents highlights of the day's two top-flight fixtures, with title-chasing Liverpool hosting relegation-threatened Wolves, while Spurs face Manchester United. Liverpool have only twice lost to Wolves in the Premier League, winning seven meetings in a row at Anfield since a 1-0 defeat in 2010. The Reds are also unbeaten at home in the league over the past five months as they seek a first top-flight title since 2020.
