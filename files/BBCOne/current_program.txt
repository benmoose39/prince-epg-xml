Garden Rescue
Donna and Dan's garden is small and messy, with lots of sharp, difficult surfaces that present a problem for their youngest daughter Emilia, who has Down's syndrome. Emilia and her sister Maya love nothing more than playing in the garden, but currently it's unsafe. The family need the garden to be redesigned with more forgiving materials, so they don't hurt themselves. Mum Donna was born and raised in Norway. She would love a garden with a Scandi theme to remind her of where she grew up.
