Escape to the Country
Two sisters want to combine their resources in Somerset to find a secluded house that has enough land to start their own music festival, though on a slightly smaller scale than the one the county is famous for. Alistair Appleton escorts them on their search and has time to visit the village of Stoke St Gregory, where an old pub has been transformed into not just the local watering hole but a community shop and caf? too.
