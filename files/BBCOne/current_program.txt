Garden Rescue
Charlie and Flo go head-to-head to design a garden with ?4,000 for Jo and Jack, to suit their lovingly restored Victorian terraced house. The garden is very long and thin and heavily overlooked, with a dumping ground at the back. They'd like a garden with some symmetry, typical of the Victorian era, sensory plants and a lawn so that Jack can perfect his stripes.
