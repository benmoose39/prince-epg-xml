Noah Cappe visits the Washington County Fair in Utah for the Twisted Pickle Roll - a deep-fried pickle sushi dream come true - and has a little dessert in the desert with the Cookie Dough Dog. Then, he's off to the Clark County Fair in Nevada for Pretzel French Toast and the spicy Cheesy Carne Brick. Finally, Noah heads to the North Florida Fair in Tallahassee for their Southern Fried Softshell Sandwich, the Fiery Fiesta Funnel Cake and Grape Gems, a candy-coated fruity treat!
