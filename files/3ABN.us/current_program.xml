    <title>3ABN Today</title>
    <desc>On this 3ABN Today program we will highlight the cooperation that exists between God's simple health remedies and faith especially when it comes to each person's health journey. We are told that natural means, used in accordance with God's will, bring about supernatural results. The beautiful testimonies shared during this program demonstrate just that. Join John &amp; Idalia Dinzey with guests from Wildwood Lifestyle Center to hear what God is doing in the lives of the Wildwood participants.</desc>
