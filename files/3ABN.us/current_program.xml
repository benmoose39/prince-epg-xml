    <desc>Sin everywhere and in everything... How much longer can all of this keep going? Join us as the pastors discuss prophetic topics such as what exactly has to happen before Christ's return, the time period between the Second Coming and the millennium, and the intriguing one day/one hour/one year equation in prophecy. Pastor Doug and Pastor Ross also guide a caller who asks how he can maintain discipline and consistency in his walk with God. A practical, honest and very important question!!</desc>
