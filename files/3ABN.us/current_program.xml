    <desc>We forget what we don't keep before our eyes-calls, emails, birthdays. When we forget our spiritual needs, the consequences are eternal. Israel's crossing of the Jordan wasn't just a physical journey-it was a call to remember God's power, presence, and promises. In a world full of distractions, their story reminds us to keep our hearts anchored in what truly matters. This week, we revisit that miraculous crossing and discover how to move forward in faith without forgetting the God who leads us.</desc>
