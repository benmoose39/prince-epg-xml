    <desc>In the final lesson of this quarter, we see how God's people-both in ancient Israel and today-are called to live in deep relationship with Him, to worship, serve, and reveal His true character to the world. Sin distorts that picture, causing fear and separation, just as Adam and Eve hid from God in Eden. Yet God always takes the first step to restore the relationship, calling gently, Where are you? (Gen. 3:9). Our mission is to reflect His love and righteousness so others are drawn to Him.</desc>
