    <title>The Incredible Journey</title>
    <desc>Bett-Bett was a key character in the classic Australian books We of the Never-Never and The Little Black Princess. Who was this Little Black Princess of the Never-Never? This was a question that readers of the books asked for decades. The true identity of Bett-Bett stayed unknown until she herself revealed it more than 60 years after the books had first been published. For decades we thought she had been lost in the bush.</desc>
