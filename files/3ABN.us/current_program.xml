    <desc>And it repented theLord that He had made man on the earth, and it grieved Him at His heart. Yet still, in Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace. This love of Christ is incomprehensible, and though we fail and grieve Him, filled with doubts toward Him or doubts of us, we are healed and empowered by His life and His sacrifice.</desc>
