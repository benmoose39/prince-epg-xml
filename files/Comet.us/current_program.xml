    <desc>In this loose interpretation of the classic Jules Verne tale, the vengeful Capt. Nemo (Sean Lawlor) has descended further into madness. Commanding his formidable undersea vessel, Nemo seeks to destroy anyone outside of his adopted ocean realm. Luckily for the rest of humanity, Lt. Michael Arronax (Lorenzo Lamas), aided by Lt. Cmdr. Lucille Conciel (Natalie Stone) and others, is on hand to try to stop Nemo's destructive quest for world domination.</desc>
