    <title>The Crow: Salvation</title>
    <desc>Alex Corvis (Eric Mabius) is falsely convicted of brutally stabbing his girlfriend Lauren to death. He maintains his innocence and insists that Lauren was killed by a man with distinctive scars on his body but the police cannot find any trace of him. After three years on death row, Alex is electrocuted in a messy execution and shortly after, his guardian crow appears and resurrects him. With the help of Lauren's sister Erin (Kirsten Dunst), the Crow begins his hunt for the killer.</desc>
