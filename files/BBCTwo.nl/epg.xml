    <desc>The final episode in the series and Derek Brockway, the Weatherman, walks along a stunning and often overlooked stretch of coastline dominated by the Second Severn Crossing or Prince of Wales Bridge. On his journey he rings an ancient church bell, finds a water scorpion which breathes through its bottom, and learns about the `Rogiet Hoard' and discovers how the village of Sudbrook evolved. He also wades into the River Severn in the footsteps of ancient fisherman and finishes in Chepstow.</desc>
