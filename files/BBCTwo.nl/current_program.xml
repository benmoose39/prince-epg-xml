    <title>Deadly Predators</title>
    <desc>Steve goes in search of the fastest Deadly Predators on earth. Using the latest CGI, Steve high-dives off a rugged cliff in Wales next to a gannet, tests the speed and accuracy of a gannet dive in a sky-high experiment in his deadly junkyard using a crane and an old caravan, and takes to the kayak for an amazing animal encounter with thousands of wild gannets.</desc>
