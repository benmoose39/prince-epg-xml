    <title>Christine's Garden</title>
    <desc>September arrives in the garden and the summer heat gives way to the first smells of autumn. Christine heads north to Bolton to visit a farmers' market where she buys lots of local produce in preparation for a Lancashire evening to be held back at home. Chorley cakes, sarsaparilla beer, Lancashire hotpot and black pudding are all on offer, as is Reg and his sing-alongs.</desc>
