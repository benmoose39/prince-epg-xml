    <desc>Paul Martin is joined by experts Michael Baggot and Adam Partridge. Together they pick out a selection of interesting antiques and collectibles to be sold at the local auction house. Michael is attracted by a collection of medals, and Adam admires a liberty pewter bowl detested by its owner. Inspired by the many pieces of war memorabilia brought to the show, Paul takes a look at 20th-century British war art at the Imperial War Museum.</desc>
