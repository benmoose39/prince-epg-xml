    <desc>Manchester Originals travel to Trent Bridge to take on Trent Rockets. In this fixture last year, the Originals failed to score two runs off the last three balls to give the Rockets a superb victory. Originals batter Jos Buttler will come up against England teammate Joe Root, as well as international stars Marcus Stoinis and Lockie Ferguson. Alex Hartley and Rick Edwards present, alongside Sir Alastair Cook, Steven Finn, Tash Farrant and Carlos Brathwaite.</desc>
