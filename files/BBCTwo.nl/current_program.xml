    <title>Pavarotti: King of the High Cs</title>
    <desc>Luciano Pavarotti sang some of opera's most demanding roles, Manrico in `Il trovatore', Rodolfo in `La boh?me' and Cavaradossi in `Tosca', winning him the highest critical acclaim. He was acknowledged a true successor to two of the greatest opera singers to have ever lived, Enrico Caruso and Beniamino Gigli. In this introspective, Pavarotti talks about his life and performs arias by Verdi, Puccini and Leoncavallo, accompanied by the Orchestra Stabile Romagna, conducted by Leone Magiera.</desc>
