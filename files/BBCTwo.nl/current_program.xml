    <title>Mexico: Earth's Festival of Life</title>
    <desc>Mexico is a vast country, over two thousand miles long, dominated by a great chain of mountains, the Sierra Madre. Journey down this rocky spine to discover an amazing diversity of life, from black bears and orchid bees to resplendent quetzals and millions of monarch butterflies. This is a land where giant volcanoes simmer and ancient and modern cultures collide in a festival of life.</desc>
