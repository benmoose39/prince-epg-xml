    <desc>In the final case of the series, Danny is joined in the studio by Angela and her daughter Emily. They tell him about events that happened to them in the early 2000s when Emily was a child. A seemingly supernatural presence that began as what Angela thought was an imaginary friend, soon grew into something far more terrifying. Both Emily and her sister became too scared to sleep in their rooms, supposedly beset by the malign presence of an old man who threatened Emily and her family.</desc>
