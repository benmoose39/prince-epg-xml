    <title>Live: WA World Athletics Championships</title>
    <desc>The men's and women's 400m reaches the semi-final stage at the World Athletics Championships, and Matthew Hudson-Smith is going for gold. Great Britain's world indoor champion Amber Anning is in action as well. Faith Kipyegon broke her own 1500m world record in June, and despite narrowly missing out on becoming the first woman to run a sub-four-minute mile, is the outstanding favourite for gold in Tokyo. And the men's 110m hurdles final finishes the action on day four.</desc>
