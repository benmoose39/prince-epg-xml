    <title>Secrets of the Jurassic Dinosaurs</title>
    <desc>Liz Bonnin joins a team of palaeontologists in the remote badlands of Wyoming as they investigate a dinosaur graveyard. The team tries to figure out if the Jurassic's most vicious predator was involved in the deaths of super-sized beasts, like the iconic Diplodocus, that are buried at the site, helping to reveal why so many dinosaurs came here and what killed them in such great numbers 150 million years ago.</desc>
