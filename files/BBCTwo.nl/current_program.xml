    <title>Beechgrove Garden</title>
    <desc>The Beechgrove team marry sustainability with staying on-trend. Carole, Kirsty and Mairi are introduced to the plant craft of Kokedama by local house plant expert Fiona Macdonald. At her Edinburgh allotment, Kirsty demonstrates that people can still be on-trend and sustainable even if they are short of space, as she shows how to create a living-herb wall made from recycled materials.</desc>
