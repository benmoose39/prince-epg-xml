    <title>Mountain Gorilla</title>
    <desc>Patrick Stewart narrates a landmark three-part series on the world's last mountain gorillas. Titus the gorilla king faces the biggest challenge of his life. He's lived longer and sired more offspring than any other known gorilla, but his time as a great leader may be coming to an end. The mighty silverback has a little orphan in his care - and both their lives hang in the balance.</desc>
