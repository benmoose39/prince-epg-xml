    <title>Tamara Drewe</title>
    <desc>Tamara Drewe returns to the sleepy Dorset village where she grew up to sell her mother's house. Once the big-nosed girl next door, she has had a nose job and is a successful journalist in London. Her old flame Andy is still working for philandering novelist Nicholas Hardiment and his long-suffering wife and, when Tamara begins a relationship with rock drummer Ben Sergeant, there begins a three-way contest for her affections.</desc>
