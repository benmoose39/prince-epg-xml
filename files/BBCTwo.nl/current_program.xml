    <title>Grand Tours of Scotland's Rivers</title>
    <desc>Paul explores the lower reaches of the river Spey, Scotland's third longest river, famous for its forests, whisky distilleries and salmon, as it flows north towards the coast. On the way Paul hears tales of loggers who floated timber down the river from the 17th century onwards. He then takes to the water in a canoe and discovers the rare and endangered freshwater mussels that were once harvested for their precious pearls, which adorn royal crowns.</desc>
