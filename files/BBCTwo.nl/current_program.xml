    <title>Mortimer and Whitehouse: Gone Fishing</title>
    <desc>It's the start of the coarse fishing season, and to celebrate Paul and Bob are in the Norfolk Broads to fish in some of East Anglia's most historic and celebrated waterways. As is the way with a trip to the Broads, Paul and Bob do away with the car and instead get around by boat. It's the quintessential Broads experience, although Paul does wonder whether he should have been captain instead of Bob.</desc>
