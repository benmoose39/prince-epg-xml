    <title>Live: WA World Athletics Championships</title>
    <desc>Katarina Johnson-Thompson's defence of her world heptathlon title reaches a conclusion with the final two events, the javelin and the 800m, on the penultimate night of action from the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo. It's a busy night for the relay teams, with the men and women's 4 x 400m and 4 x 100m heats. After Great Britain won gold in all four events at the 2024 Paris Olympics, hopes are high for more medals, but they will have to reach tomorrow's finals first.</desc>
