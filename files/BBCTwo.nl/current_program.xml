    <title>The Titfield Thunderbolt</title>
    <desc>The village of Titfield's single-track railway link to Mallingford is closed down because it is losing money. The villagers, roused by train enthusiast Weech, plan to run the line independently with a rich eccentric Valentine providing the money, but their action arouses the opposition of the local bus company, run by Pearce and Vernon Crump, who attempt various acts of sabotage when the new line is opened.</desc>
