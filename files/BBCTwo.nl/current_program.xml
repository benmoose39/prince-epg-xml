    <title>Trawlermen: Hunting the Catch</title>
    <desc>Off the coast of Yorkshire, Siwrengale is heading out for the beginning of the North Sea whelk season. Skipper Darren Warters is on the hunt with sons Regan and Lewis. Asian demand has created a lucrative fishery in this small patch of the North Sea, but winter storms have badly damaged their pots. Miles of rope must be untangled before they can begin fishing in earnest. South east of Shetland is 'Long Hole' - the deepest waters in the North Sea.</desc>
