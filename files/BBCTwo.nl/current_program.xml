    <desc>The team presents from Culzean Castle on the west coast of Scotland. Experts Anita Manning and Natasha Raskin Sharp are on hand to find a selection of objects to take to auction. A watercolour with a local connection catches Anita's eye, while Natasha is drawn to a gorgeous handwoven blanket. Paul Martin explores a hidden part of Culzean's history, uncovering the tales of smugglers working the coastline in the caves beneath the castle walls.</desc>
