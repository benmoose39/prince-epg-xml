    <title>Trawlermen: Hunting the Catch</title>
    <desc>It's the last trip before Christmas and, with demand surging, fish prices are rising. Off the south coast of Cornwall, Ocean Pride is heading out in pursuit of pollock among the old sunken shipwrecks of the English Channel. 380 miles away on the Yorkshire coast, crabber Tydus is preparing to head out with hopes of a big pay day. The aim is to put six tons in the tank, a catch that this week could fetch well over ?30,000.</desc>
