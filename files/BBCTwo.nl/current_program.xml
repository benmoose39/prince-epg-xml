    <title>Live: UCI Road World Championships</title>
    <desc>Jill Douglas presents live coverage of the UCI Road World Championships men's time trial - the first to be held in Africa - as the world's best compete on a hilly course around Kigali, Rwanda. Slovenian superstar Tadej Pogacar embarks on the first part of his bid to claim the time trial and road race double in Kigali, but reigning world champion Remco Evenepoel - the last man to claim both titles in the same year in 2022 - also has his eyes on the world title.</desc>
