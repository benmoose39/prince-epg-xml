    <title>Live: WA World Athletics Championships</title>
    <desc>Day three of the World Athletics Championships draws to a close as Josh Kerr continues the defence of his 1500m crown. First, though, he has to get through the semi-finals. The men's pole vault concludes, and can world record holder Mondo Duplantis claim a third consecutive world title? There's also coverage of the men's 300m steeplechase final, and the women's 100m hurdles champion is also crowned.</desc>
