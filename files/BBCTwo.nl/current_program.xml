    <title>Animals with Cameras</title>
    <desc>In Namibia, Gordon joins a cheetah conservationist who wants to see if three orphaned cheetahs, which she has raised from a day old, can learn to hunt effectively in the thick vegetation. In Australia, the team put cameras on fur seals to try to see how they hunt their prey and avoid attacks by great white sharks. In South Africa, the team deploy the first ever cameras on wild baboons in an effort to understand why these clever monkeys sometimes raid farmers' crops.</desc>
