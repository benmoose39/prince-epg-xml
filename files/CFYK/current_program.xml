    <title>Murdoch Mysteries</title>
    <desc>Based on novels by Maureen Jennings, &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot; follows young detective William Murdoch. In a series of stories taking place in Toronto during the 1890s and early 1900s, several challenging murder cases arise. Murdoch uses up-and-coming forensics techniques and an unconventional approach, which often elicit skepticism from his fellow officers and his boss. Coroner Julia Ogden becomes Murdoch's number one ally, and they make a top-notch team, but he must struggle against tradition and prejudice to solve some of the city's most-gruesome murders.</desc>
