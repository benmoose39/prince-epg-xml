    <desc>The top-notch team of hosts Bob McKeown, Gillian Findlay, Mark Kelley and Habiba Nosheen provides unique and engaging documentaries from Canada and beyond. &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; is a reference to the term Fourth Estate, and was chosen to highlight the program's determination to go beyond everyday news into original journalism. The series has won numerous awards for its reporting, including Gemini Awards, International Emmys, the Michener Award, and even an Academy Award for a 1981 episode that was released in theaters the following year.
