    <title>The Great Canadian Baking Show</title>
    <desc>The series brings together 10 amateur bakers from across Canada to compete in a series of themed culinary challenges that celebrate their diverse backgrounds, families and communities. Each episode features three rounds: the Signature Bake, the Technical Bake and the Show Stopper. After the judges taste and critique the bakes, they crown one Star Baker and ask one baker to leave the tent. The final three bakers compete for the title. &quot;The Great Canadian Baking Show&quot; is an affirming, warm-spirited competition that celebrates personal achievement and the joy of baking.</desc>
