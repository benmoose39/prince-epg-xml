    <title>Bosai: Science That Can Save Your Life</title>
    <desc>In September 2018, the Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake knocked out power of the entire region, affecting up to 2.95 million households.

People's lives were greatly affected, as medical equipment failed and logistics systems were disrupted. What can we do to prevent such large-scale power outages? Find out what research institutes and local communities are doing to take steps against massive blackouts.</desc>
