    <title>Silent Conversations In The Making \</title>
    <desc>Deaf and hearing actors performed together in a production of Shakespeare's classic comedy using Japanese sign language and verbal Japanese, which was broadcasted in January 2024. In this special program we look at the behind-the-scenes of how this performance was created. Most of the hearing actors had never worked with Deaf actors before, so it brought about a new challenge. During rehearsals, the cast underwent a process of trial and error as they examined each other's lines in sign language and verbal Japanese trying to coordinate their timing, with mixed results. Deaf actors and directors dug deep until the very last minute of filming to determine what sign language expressions were best suited for Shakespeare's eloquence. In the process, the entire crew discovered what it means for the two groups of actors to work together in this unprecedented artistic experiment.</desc>
