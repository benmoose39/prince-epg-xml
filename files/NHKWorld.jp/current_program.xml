    <title>Bosai: Science That Can Save Your Life</title>
    <desc>In September 2018, the Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake knocked out power of the entire region, affecting up to 2.95 million households.

Find out what research institutes and local communities are doing to take steps against massive blackouts.</desc>
