    <desc>Making use of his vast experience, dyer Izawa Tsuyoshi has added a touch of color to all kinds of things. And two years ago, he began a new undertaking; dyeing old and worn-out clothes black. This has several benefits. Black hides damage and stains and makes old look new. Izawa worked to develop a black dye that would work on fabric of any color. Bringing clothes destined for the trash back in black has brought in so much business that there's currently a three-month waiting list for the service.</desc>
