    <title>Bosai: Science That Can Save Your Life</title>
    <desc>The Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 and its resulting tsunami caused the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. The worst nuclear accident in Japan's history suffered from a lack of information due to the inaccessibility of the reactor buildings. For this reason, \&quot;disaster response robots\&quot; were deployed to take pictures and measure radiation doses inside the buildings. In the aftermath of a major disaster like that as well as an earthquake or fire, robots can quickly enter dangerous sites that are inaccessible to humans, find people in need of rescue, and take detailed measurements to provide data about the site. In this episode, we'll look at the latest developments among Japan's \&quot;disaster response robots.\.</desc>
