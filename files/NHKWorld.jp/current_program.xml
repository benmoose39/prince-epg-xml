    <title>Magical Japanese</title>
    <desc>The Japanese language is rich in words and expressions influenced by nature, history and culture. This episode focuses on words related to doro, or mud. Since ancient times, Japanese people have gotten muddy in the rice paddies, cultivating their main staple. Perhaps because of this, there are a surprising number of expressions related to mud in Japanese. And reflecting such a place of hard work, many of them are used in business situations. From his home in Kyoto Prefecture, poet and literary translator Peter MacMillan guides us through unique words born from \&quot;mud.\.</desc>
