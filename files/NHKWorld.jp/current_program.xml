    <desc>Kisoji is an old road that runs through Kiso in Nagano Prefecture, which is located along the Nakasendo, one of the main highroads connecting Tokyo and Kyoto Prefecture. Stretching 80 kilometers from north to south, the Kisoji is home to 11 \&quot;post towns\&quot; along its trail. The road has been used for about 400 years, with feudal lords from all over Japan using it to get to Tokyo to serve the shogun during the Samurai period. In this episode, we tour the post towns and see the deep facets of the Kisoji route.</desc>
