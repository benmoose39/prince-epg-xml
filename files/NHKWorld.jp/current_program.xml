    <title>Easy Japanese For Work</title>
    <desc>Today: words of support for a coworker. Nguyen Thi Thuy Trang, from Vietnam, works at a company that makes paper products. She began studying Japanese out of a love for Japanese manga, and she came to Japan two years ago as a technical intern. At her job, she works in quality inspection. She needs a high level of focus to check for any imperfections. She'd like to forge a closer bond with her coworkers, who often push themselves to work hard even when they aren't feeling their best. In a roleplay challenge, she must reach out to a coworker who has back pain to offer words of support.</desc>
