    <title>Journeys In Japan</title>
    <desc>In 1859, when Japan reopened its doors after more than two centuries of isolation, goods flowed in and out of newly expanded ports. At the time, raw silk became the country's largest export, as the silk industries in France and Italy had been hit by an epidemic of silkworm disease. At one point, Japan was the world's biggest exporter. On this episode of Journeys in Japan, Sheila Cliffe from the UK follows the Silk Road from northern Kanto, once a major production area, to Yokohama, where the silk took off to the world.</desc>
