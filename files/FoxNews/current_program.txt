Live: Outnumbered
Approximately 51 percent of the U.S. population is made up of women, but on "Outnumbered" the female advantage jumps to a 4-1 ratio. The hourlong show features a rotating panel of four women and one man discussing the day's headlines from various perspectives. In addition to the top news of the hour, the panelists discuss leading pop culture and relationship issues making headlines that day. Regular FNC and FBN contributors appearing on the show on a rotational basis include Harris Faulkner, Meghan McCain and Pete Hegseth.
