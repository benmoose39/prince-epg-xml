    <title>Dragons' Den</title>
    <desc>Grar! Bring the sacrificial virgins! No, no. That's not the type of dragon this series is talking about; these dragons are of the business kind. Five people, the dragons, hold the money reins. People with business propositions approach them with ideas and hope those ideas are interesting enough for one of the dragons to give them thousands of dollars to see their dreams get off the ground. Host Dianne Buckner ushers the victims into the dragons' den.</desc>
