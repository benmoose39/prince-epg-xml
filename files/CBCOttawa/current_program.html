Developed from Critch's 2018 memoir, which was in turn based on his real life experiences growing up in Newfoundland, Canada, the series is a heartfelt window in the life of a child who is much older inside than his 11 years. He uses comedy and self-deprecation to win friends and connect with the small collection of people in his limited junior high world.</div></div></div>
