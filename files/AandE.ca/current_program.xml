    <title>WWE LFG</title>
    <desc>Focus shifts to the male competitors, as the LFG Playoffs continue! Shiloh Hill and Drake Morreaux kick things off with a hard-hitting matchup, while Anthony Luke and Trill London make decision time difficult for Coach McCool. Then, Harlem Lewis looks to put down Chris Island and move one step closer to that NXT contract. And in the main event, BJ Ray thinks he has a free pass to the semi-finals... but Coach Bubba has a much different idea.</desc>
