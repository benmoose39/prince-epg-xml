    <desc>Four men and four women remain as we enter the LFG Semi-Finals! Shiloh Hill and Anthony Luke leave the coaches stunned with a hard-hitting battle for the ages. In a rematch of last season's semi-finals, Zena Sterling looks to take down the top seeded P-Nasty, but did she bite off more than she can chew? Sirena Linton and Dani Sekelsky look to claw their way into the semis as they go one-on-one. And it's pandemonium in the main event, as Harlem Lewis and Drake Morreaux bring LFG to a halt!</desc>
