    <title>The Mother Flip</title>
    <desc>Rebecca and Kristy get a hot tip about a former rental property in the outskirts of Austin. Within city limits and close to the airport, the ranch-style home definitely has a country feel. The outside looks like a junkyard, while the inside feels like a dope crash pad where the former residents seem to have let their hippie flags fly. But the price tag is low, and the profit potential is high, making this joint a no-brainer to flip.</desc>
