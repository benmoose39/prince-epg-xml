    <desc>The quest for an NXT contract kicks into high gear, as the women take center stage for the LFG Playoffs. Bayley Humphrey and Dani Sekelsky go head-to-head, as Undertaker has the unenviable task of choosing which of his star pupils will move on to the next round. P-Nasty looks to make an emphatic statement at the expense of Summer Sorrell, while Zena Sterling and Haze Jameson both look to impress Coach Bubba. And in the main event, Sirena Linton and Tatyanna Dumas pull out all the stops.</desc>
