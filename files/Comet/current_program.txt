Early in the 21st century, technological advances have made it possible for aging, wealthy people to pay crooks like Vacendak (Mick Jagger) to go back in time, kidnap young victims like race car driver Alex Furlong (Emilio Estevez) and deliver them to the elderly clients, who then have their brains transplanted into the healthy bodies. Furlong manages to break free from his captors, but as a fugitive, he finds that the world of the future is a bleak, dangerous place.
