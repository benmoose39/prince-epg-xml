Dragonquest
After the ruthless Krill (Brian Thompson) harnesses the power of a deadly fire-breathing dragon, he begins a bloody campaign of world domination. From the ashes of a scorched village, Arkadi (Daniel Bonjour), an unassuming farm boy, embarks on an arduous journey to restore the lost pieces of a mystical amulet - the only weapon powerful enough to destroy Krill. With the help of swordsman Maxim (Marc Singer) and his squire, Katya (Jennifer Dorogi), Arkadi struggles to save the world.
