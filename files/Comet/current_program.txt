Season of the Witch
His faith broken by many years fighting in the Crusades, a knight named Behman (Nicolas Cage) returns to Europe and finds it ravaged by the Black Plague. A dying cardinal orders Behman and his friend, Felson (Ron Perlman), to take an accused witch to a remote abbey, where monks will destroy her powers and end the pestilence. As Behman and five comrades undertake the dangerous journey, they come to realize that the prisoner is no ordinary girl, and evil forces await at the destination.
