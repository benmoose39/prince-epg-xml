Coneheads
Cone-headed extraterrestrials Beldar (Dan Aykroyd) and Prymaat (Jane Curtin) find themselves in New Jersey after a recon mission for their home planet of Remulak goes awry. Stranded, they are forced to live as typical suburban humans. Beldar gets a job, and daughter Connie (Michelle Burke) grows up to be a typical, if oddly shaped, teenager. When INS agents start investigating the family and Beldar receives sinister orders from Remulak, the Coneheads must decide where their allegiance lies.
