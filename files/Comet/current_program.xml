    <title>The Canterville Ghost</title>
    <desc>Ginny Otis (Neve Campbell) is a teenage girl who moves to England with her family to inhabit creaky old Canterville Hall. She lobbies for her father to send her back home, and is even more adamant when she encounters a ghost and an inexplicable bloodstain. But when Ginny befriends the ghost, Sir Simon de Canterville (Patrick Stewart), and meets the attractive Duke of Cheshire (Daniel Betts), she decides she wants to stay and help Sir Simon escape his centuries-long curse.</desc>
