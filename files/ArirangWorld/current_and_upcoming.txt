In light of these changes, the role of science and technology has become increasingly crucial.  Korea, surrounded by the sea on three sides, has long been blessed with abundant marine and fisheries resources. Through the integration of clean and abundant marine resources with the advanced technologies of domestic small and medium-sized enterprises, a wide range of marine-related products are being developed.

K-OCEAN MARVELS 2024
The world's ocean, which cover 70% of the globe, hold an immense wealth of resources. It houses a staggering 80% of Earth's biodiversity. However, their utilization rate remains at less than 1%. Harnessing and utilizing these high-value marine resources is anticipated to be the key driver of the global marine and fisheries era.  The marine and fisheries sector is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by the fourth industrial revolution and climate change, leading us toward a digital age and a decarbonized society. In light of these changes, the role of science and technology has become increasingly crucial.  Korea, surrounded by the sea on three sides, has long been blessed with abundant marine and fisheries resources. Through the integration of clean and abundant marine resources with the advanced technologies of domestic small and medium-sized enterprises, a wide range of marine-related products are being developed. We introduce you to Korea?s small and medium-sized enterprises in the forefront of leading the next generation of the marine and fisheries era.
