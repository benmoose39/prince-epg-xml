Korea has established diplomatic relations with a total of 194 countries. Among them are countries that have had ties and exchanges with Korea for hundreds of years. With such long-standing relationships with so many nations, might there be fascinating hidden stories between Korea and the rest of the world that we don?t know yet?   \"Diplomat?s Archives: Hidden Stories\" begins with this very question. Together with foreign embassies in Korea, the series uncovers and sheds light on meaningful yet lesser-known stories between Korea and other countries. Through this, we aim to reaffirm the deep friendships that have been built over time, highlight how countries are interconnected?bilaterally and multilaterally? and emphasize the importance of cooperation on the global stage today.</div></div></div>
