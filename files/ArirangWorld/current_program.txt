WE ARE DIPLOMATS
Who says only diplomats can engage in diplomacy?  In the era of public diplomacy, WE ARE ALL DIPLOMATS!With interdependence between nations higher than ever before, and more people from diverse backgrounds living together than ever before, to coexist peacefully, we must collaborate regardless of nationality, race, or culture.  ?? is a program that showcases the vibrant scenes of cooperation between Korea and other countries through the medium of embassies in Korea.  ?? defines everyone who connects Korea with other countries as a \"diplomat.\"  Shall we broaden our understanding of each other by meeting all the diplomats in the world?
