While the age when late-night shows starring the high-teen stars in the 80s and 90s were the main talk of the town has passed, there still remain places that make us want to relive the moments of our shared interests in the waves of over-the-top platforms and content production.   While their fame from the past faded, there are old towns and districts and the people who love them.  ?Archive Local Documentary? strives to remember and explore the places that still remain to this day or have already faded.  ?
