TASTE LOG
What kind of spaces draw you in? What hobbies stay with you? And the objects?what objects do you reach for, without thinking?  If you haven?t found your taste yet, here?s something a little different. A quiet record of what feels like you.  A project to trace the shape of your taste, Taste Log.
