    <title>Solos f?r Klarinette</title>
    <desc>The great clarinettist Paolo Beltramini plays a program of solo pieces for clarinet on Stingray Brava. In this broadcast, Beltramini performs C.P.E. Bach's Solfeggietto, B?la Kov?c's Hommage ? Paganini, and Igor Stravinsky's Three Pieces for Clarinet Solo. Paolo Beltramini is the only Italian clarinettist to have won first prize at the prestigious Prague Spring International Clarinet Competition (1996). As a duo with pianist Roberto Arosio, he won the International Chamber Music Competitions in Paris (1996) and Trapani (1997). These awards helped establish Beltramini's reputation as one of the most interesting wind-instrument virtuosos on the international concert circuit. He was principal clarinettist with Amsterdam's Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, Milan's Filarmonica della Scala, Mahler Chamber Orchestra and Swiss Orchestra della Svizzera italiana.</desc>
