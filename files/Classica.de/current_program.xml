    <desc>Claudio Abbado leads the Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra in a performance of Arnold Sch?nberg's symphonic poem 'Pelleas und Melisande', Op. 5. With the encouragement of Richard Strauss, Sch?nberg composed the work during 1902-1903. The piece is inspired by a play about a doomed love by Belgian writer Maurice Maeterlinck. Written in the key of D minor, Pelleas und Melisande is one of the composer's early tonal works in the late Romantic style. The work is scored for a large orchestra and is in one continuous movement that lasts approximately 38 minutes. This performance was recorded at the Musikverein Vienna, Austria, in 2006.</desc>
