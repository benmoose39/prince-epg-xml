    <title>Liszt</title>
    <desc>Franz Liszt (1811 ? 1886) composed 13 symphonic poems, largely inspired by literary texts. The composer himself wrote piano duet arrangements for these pieces, showcasing his incredible ability of imitating a full orchestra on the piano. Liszt, one of the 19th century's most important piano virtuosos, strongly influenced the further development of piano music. The Romantic period was the era of the virtuoso pianists: the piano was the instrument of choice for countless musicians and listeners alike. No house of standing could do without a piano: it was a status symbol. Piano music was played in concert halls, palaces, salons, churches and public houses alike. Liszt's symphonic poem no. 4, 'Orpheus', breathes a meditative atmosphere. No. 3, 'Les Pr?ludes', is best known in its symphonic version ? the piano version presented here is rarely heard. The work dates back to the period 1848 ? 1854 and was initially meant to serve as introduction to a choral cycle to be based on the texts of the poet Joseph Autran, 'Les quatre ?l?ments': earth, air, water and fire. In this broadcast, the Italian piano duo of Marco Sollini and Salvatore Barbatano performs these Liszt piano works. These recordings were made at the beautiful 12th century church of San Marco in the small but picturesque village of Ponzano di Fermo, as part of the 2015 edition of the annual, itinerant festival &quot;Armonie della sera&quot; in the Italian province of Le Marche.</desc>
