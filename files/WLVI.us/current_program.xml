    <desc>Geared toward children, this educational program teaches its audience about food preparation and healthy choices in a fun and entertaining way. Hosts and &quot;Taste Buds&quot; Avery, Matt and Lily work through recipes and learn facts about food with the &quot;Taste Buddies.&quot; In addition to teaching cooking techniques and concepts, the show also demonstrates how to use recycled food in arts and crafts and teaches how to manage a budget, with an ultimate goal of encouraging parents and their children to cook together and become more aware of the environment.</desc>
