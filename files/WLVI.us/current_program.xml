    <title>The Steve Wilkos Show</title>
    <desc>The former Chicago cop and security guard of &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot; gets his own talk show that is adapted from the popular &quot;Steve to the Rescue&quot; shows he did while filling in for Springer. Wilkos says he hopes his show will provide him with a platform to stand up for everyday people and help viewers in need. Common topics include trying to confirm - often using results of lie-detector tests - whether guests abused or molested children. Steve also helps guests determine paternity and if guests are cheating on their partners. If Steve doesn't like the guests they might not last long on the show.</desc>
