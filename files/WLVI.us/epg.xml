    <title>SOS: How to Survive</title>
    <desc>If a person is in a life-or-death battle with the elements, his or her knowledge of what to do in the situation can be the difference between walking away from it alive or not. Survivalist Creek Stewart and his team want to help people learn what to do in perilous scenarios with this show that teaches innovative skills to help people survive when they're in trouble. Stewart recaps real-life survival situations and gives his opinion on what the people involved did right and wrong as they fought for their lives.
