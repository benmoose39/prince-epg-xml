    <title>Bob Hearts Abishola</title>
    <desc>Bob, a middle-aged compression sock businessman from Detroit, unexpectedly falls for his cardiac nurse while recovering from a heart attack and sets his sights on winning her over. Undaunted by Abishola's lack of initial interest or the vast differences in their backgrounds - she's originally from Nigeria - Bob is determined to win Abishola's heart, in this comedic examination of immigrant life in America. From award-winning creator, executive producer and writer Chuck Lorre.[(96057)] </desc>
