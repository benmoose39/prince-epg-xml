    <title>Hello World</title>
    <desc>Business journalist Ashlee Vance hosts this series that explores how technology is shaping the future. Each episode focuses on a different country, exploring ways in which the local culture and geography influence the nation's approach to technology. Vance searches for the inventors and scientists behind the innovations to see how they are changing the future. On his journey, Vance finds fresh - and sometimes weird - tech creations, including robot exoskeletons and virtual reality characters in New Zealand.</desc>
